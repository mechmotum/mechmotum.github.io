      <p>Little safety driven engineering goes into the design and
construction of ski and snowboard jumps in terrain parks at
publicly accessible ski resorts. Catastrophic injuries and
even deaths occur during skiing and snowboarding at these
resorts. It is possible to design the landing surfaces of
jumps such that the normal impact velocity on landing is
capped at a safer value regardless of the jumper's takeoff
speed and jump launch speed. These jump designs can still
provide large maximum heights and flight durations for
participant fun. We have designed a web application that
laypeople can use to design and analyze ski jumps with
specified equivalent fall height in mind.</p>

Instrumenting rowers during training and competition with
laboratory quality sensing is very difficult, but the
ubiquity of smartphones provides an avenue to collect fewer
and less accurate kinematic and kinetic measurements. This
project aims to improve performance critical biomechanic
rowing metrics through dynamics informed estimation
algorithms. We have developed rower adaptive filtering
methods to predict global boat position, speed, stroke rate,
and distance per stroke at high accuracy and with
experimental protocols for validating the estimations.</p>

      <p>Our goal with this project is to develop metrics that
quantify the handling, i.e. ease of control, of a bicycle or
other single track vehicle and using these metrics develop
methods for designing bicycles with specified handling
characteristics. We have developed an optimization algorithm
that can discover bicycle designs which maximize the lateral
handling qualities of the vehicle. The algorithm currently
produces less-than-intuitive but physically feasible bicycle
designs. These methods can likely be extended to any
human-machine system design.</p>

      <p>Mechanical and civil engineers utilize two- and
three-dimensional theories of stress and strain to determine
if structural beams will fail. Simple mathematical models
can be used to make accurate predictions of failure due to
shear, bending, and torsion stresses and due to deflection.
Solving beam related problems typically involves integrating
discontinuous functions and solving for boundary conditions.
The integral calculus and algebra details often hide the
trees for the woods. This project is centered around
developing a package for SymPy that can be used to model and
solve analytical beam problems, without getting bogged down
in the mathematical details.</p>

      <p>Humans unconsciously utilize a control strategy while
standing. Visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensing
inform the brain's control strategy which reacts to
internally and environmentally produced perturbations. This
is something humans are very good at but robots are bad at,
thus if we can understand how humans accomplish this we can
potentially design robots with biomimetic controllers. In
laboratory settings we can accurately measure body segment
kinematics, muscle activation levels, and ground force
reactions during standing. Given all or subsets of this data
collected during externally perturbed standing, we are
interested in developing optimal control theories and
methods of identifying the specific control strategy in use.</p>

      <p>We have developed a inexpensive centrifugal pump that
attaches to a simple power takeoff on a Buffalo Bike. Our
hypothesis is that a less efficient centrifugal pump paired
with power generation from cycling will be overall more
efficient than a more efficient positive displacement pump
paired with stepping power generation. We have recently
shown this to be true by accurately measuring the input
biomechanical power and output hydraulic power from both
systems to produce efficiency curves as a function of
hydraulic load.</p>
