<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the end of the Fall Quarter 2019 and Winter Quarter 2020, we focused on
building a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/ckeditor-binder-plugin">CKEditor Binder Plugin</a> to be used on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://libretexts.org">LibreTexts</a> website to allow textbook authors to
insert executable code blocks. We intend for both textbook authors and readers
to have the ability to edit and run code blocks efficiently, making online
educational content more interactive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="build-process">
<h2>Build Process</h2>
<p>We started the project by <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eV08l_4djKJ7bc8r0LPbD5bp3QT7mHTZgABUleH15H0/edit?usp=sharing">surveying</a>
LibreTexts authors and readers on their most requested features.</p>
<div class="section" id="binderhub">
<h3>BinderHub</h3>
<p>On the backend, the CKEditor Binder plugin utilizes a project called <a class="reference external" href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">BinderHub</a> to run code blocks. BinderHub
is developed as part of the Jupyter project and gives custom computing
environments based on a list of requirements specified through a GitHub
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thebelab">
<h3>Thebelab</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/minrk/thebelab">Thebelab</a> and  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ines/juniper">Juniper</a> are two examples of projects which can
insert code blocks into HTML pages and running them by requesting a kernel from
a computing backend like BinderHub. We found that Juniper had some better deign
elements; however, Thebelab was more actively maintained.  We deliberated on
which project to incorporate into our plugin, and decided to use Thebelab since
the recent commits indicated that any possible need for help would be more
promptly met. To incorporate some of the streamlined design elements of
Juniper, we planned on adding syntax highlighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-plugin">
<h3>Creating the plugin</h3>
<p>Our plugin is based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/">CKEditor 4</a>, an open source “what you see
is what you get” text editor. This is the editor authors use on the LibreTexts
website.</p>
<p>Our approach to this plugin is to make use of a <a class="reference external" href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/widget_sdk_intro.html">widget</a>, on
the editor which allows us to place all the HTML elements of Thebelab together
as one unit. In other words the widget is a component made out of multiple
separate elements that are grouped together for easy formatting and movement;
however, individual parts can be altered independently. This allows for the
CKEditor instance to easily enforce the elements. Additionally, we created a
<a class="reference external" href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_howtos_dialog_windows.html">dialog window</a>
for each code block so that users can modify each block whenever they want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mindtouch-specific-settings">
<h3>Mindtouch Specific Settings</h3>
<p>One of the challenges we faced was working around Mindtouch, which sometimes
caused the plugin to function in unexpected ways. For reference, Mindtouch is
the web based wiki software that Libretexts uses and it uses a CKEditor. An
example of an obstacle we faced was that Mindtouch seemed to apply its own CSS
to the plugin.  This caused text overflow, addition of characters to the end of
each line, etc.  In order to resolve this, we added our own <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/ckeditor-binder-plugin/tree/staging/src/styles">styling</a>
to the plugin. If one wishes to use the CKEditor plugin on their own pages,
they can remove the extra styling in the folder.</p>
<p>Another difference was JavaScript conflict. When we were trying to support
Jupyter Widgets, we found that it depended on Require.js. However, adding
Require.js to Mindtouch would break all the JQuery plugins. In order to fix all
the JavaScript conflicts, we created registerPlugin.js to include all Mindtouch
specific JavaScript code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="including-different-programming-languages">
<h3>Including different programming languages</h3>
<p>During development, we used <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/binder-examples">environments developed by the Jupyter project</a>. Using their Binder environments helped
us test and include different languages in our editor. Eventually we will
utilize, we would utilize the same <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/libretexts/default-env">default environment</a> in our JupyterHub for our
editor. This default environment contains many packages that are commonly used
and requested by students and faculty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="github-actions">
<h3>Github Actions</h3>
<p>We made use of Github Actions to automate two important tasks. After each push
on Github, it will trigger our custom linter to ensure code quality and
consistency. Additionally, if we push any code to the master branch, it will
trigger an automatic deploy to production.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ckeditor-capabilities">
<h2>CKEditor Capabilities</h2>
<p>Currently authors publishing on the LibreTexts platform have the option to
insert executable code blocks using <tt class="docutils literal">Octave</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">SageMath</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Julia</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">R</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">Python</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">C++</tt>. There is a possibility that other languages may be
added in the future. Authors can choose to either copy and paste their code
into the text editor, or directly code in the text editor as they would any
other one. To ensure that it is easy for the author as well as the reader of
the textbook to view the contents within the code block, as described in the
aforementioned section, syntax highlighting is made available via
<tt class="docutils literal">CodeMirror</tt> for all the languages except <tt class="docutils literal">SageMath</tt> which is not supported
by <tt class="docutils literal">CodeMirror</tt>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we suggest authors <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt> the sample <tt class="docutils literal">Hello
World</tt> print statement first to get the kernel started, once that is
successful, code can be added in the dialog box. For <tt class="docutils literal">C++</tt>, if the code has
already been <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt>, but the author wants to make any changes, they will need
to <tt class="docutils literal">restart</tt> the kernel in order to avoid an <tt class="docutils literal">Interpreter Error</tt> as any
variables will be assigned more than once in <tt class="docutils literal">Binder</tt> which is not allowed in
<tt class="docutils literal">C++</tt>.</p>
<p>Packages and libraries can be exported as they normally would; however, if an
author finds that a specific package or library that they would like to use is
not currently available they can make a request to have it added by either
sending an <a class="reference external" href="mailto:jupyterteam&#64;ucdavis.edu">email to the Jupyter Team</a>, linked in
the dialog box, or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/ckeditor-binder-plugin/issues">open an issue</a> .</p>
<p>Once the author is ready to insert the code block into their textbook page,
they have the option to either 'Insert with code and output,' 'Insert with code
only,' or 'Insert with output only.' Selection of any of these choices depends
on how the author intends to communicate the information provided in the code
block. If the code block has already been inserted into the page, and the
author wants to make any changes, they can simply double click on that section
and the dialog box will pop back up.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, a long term goal is to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default-env</span></tt> for the
packages, this is the same environment that is used for the LIbreTexts-UCD
JupyterHub, and by</p>
<p>using this, authors will have a greater selection of packages and libraries to
choose from, and it will also be easier for us to maintain. We also want to
improve the execution time of the code blocks, as currently requesting a kernel
involves downloading an image from DockerHub and creating a Docker container.</p>
