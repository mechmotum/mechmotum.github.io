<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">1.0 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The overall goal of this project is to design and implement a control system
for an instrumented ebike used in bicycle handling experimentation. A previous
blog post found <a class="reference external" href="ebike-controller-design">here</a></p>
<p>outlines the design and analysis of a PID controller that meets the steady
state error goal of +/- 0.1m/s. This blog post tells the story of how the
designed PID controller was implemented on the instrumented ebike using an
Arduino Nano.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-operation-functionality">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">2.0 System Operation &amp; Functionality</a></h2>
<p>The implementation of the PID controller on the electric bike was fundamentally
informed by the interactions that the user would have with the system. A
typical user interaction with the system is outlined in Figure 1 below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="User Interaction." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/UserInteractionFlowChart.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 1. A typical user interaction with the system.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This user interaction flowchart was used to help better understand the problem
and sculpt the concept for the hardware and software design of the speed
control system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-architecture">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">3.0 System Architecture</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="control-architecture">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">3.1 Control Architecture</a></h3>
<p>The control architecture is a simple feedback design that computes the error
between a user defined setpoint and compares it to the speed of the ebike as
measured via a DC generator wheel speed sensor (more on this in section 5.2).
Figure 2, shows how this error is inputted to the control algorithm encoded in
the Arduino Nano resulting in an output variable used to control the speed of
the ebike.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Control Architecture." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/BlogPost2ControlArchitecture.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 2. Control architecture.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-architecture">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">3.2 Physical Architecture</a></h3>
<p>At the heart of the control system’s physical architecture is its integration
into the existing instrumented ebike platform.  Figure 3, below, shows this
integration by highlighting the input/output and geometric relationships
between existing components of the ebike and the additional control system
components.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="System Architecture." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/ControlSystemGeometricLayout.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 3. Geometric layout of the system components showing relative size,
location, information flow, and type of each component. Components called
out with a triangle are existing components on the ebike. Components called
out with a circle are components that are introduced to the ebike system to
implement the controller.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The fundamental interaction between the control system and the existing ebike
powertrain system occurs at the interface between the Arduino nano and the
ebike motor controller. While the cruise control is engaged, the function of
the Arduino is to take control of the throttle signal away from the user and
pass it through the control algorithm before sending it to the motor
controller. When the cruise control is disengaged, the Arduino simply reads the
user commanded throttle position and passes it directly to the motor
controller.  Figure 4, below, graphically shows this interaction.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">4.0 Software</a></h2>
<p>The control system software was written in C using the Arduino IDE. Based on
user inputs from two momentary pushbuttons, the software decides whether or not
to pass the throttle signal as an output or compute a throttle output based on
the PID controller. The software also updates the user on the current status of
the system via an LCD and logs diagnostic information to an SD card.</p>
<p>Figure 5, below, shows the logic flow of the code.</p>

<div class="section" id="code-libraries">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">4.1 Code Libraries</a></h3>
<p>The continuous time PID controller derived in part one of this blog post series
was digitized on the Arduino Nano using Brett Beauregard’s PID_v1 library
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library">(found here)</a>. This library
was developed by Brett to implement PID controllers on an Arduino
microcontroller.</p>
<p>Brett’s library was chosen to implement the PID controller because of its many
robust features such as Derivative Kick and Initialization.  Additionally, this
library contains fantastic documentation which can be <a class="reference external" href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/">found here</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid slowing the code’s main loop, interrupts were used to manage the
change in setpoint brought on by a press of the speed increment decrement
buttons. Using interrupts free’s up the Arduino’s processor from having to
check whether or not there’s been a button press on every loop iteration.
Instead, the processor reacts to pin changes and interrupts the execution of
the main code to perform the function tied to the interrupt pin. However, the
Arduino Nano only has a limited number of pins that can be used as interrupts.
A library, written by GreyGnome <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GreyGnome/PinChangeInt">(found here)</a>, enables the use of interrupts
on any pin of the Arduino Nano.  This library was used to free up pin real
estate for the many components that are wired up to the Arduino.</p>

<p>Jason Moore, the lab’s PI, originally began constructing the instrumented ebike
platform in 2009 from a large Surly single speed off road steel frame bicycle
converted to an ebike with a conversion kit sold by Amped Bikes. The Amped
Bikes kit consists of a brushless direct drive hub motor driven by a motor
controller and a 36V Li ion battery. More information on the build and the
bike’s instrumentation system can be found in Jason’s dissertation <a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/dissertation/davisbicycle.html">found here</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The Arduino Nano and the voltage divider circuits were soldered to a small 3" x
1.1" piece of stripboard. Wires, braided 22AWG, were soldered to the stripboard
to connect the external components to the Nano. Figure 8, below, shows the
completed Arduino board.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Arduino Board." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/ArduinoBoardWiredUp.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 8. The Arduino board with wires attached.</em></p>
</div>
<p>With many of the components located on the handlebars, a majority of these
wires were routed together along the top tube, up the head tube and stretched
across to the handlebars. This task was facilitated using spiral wound cable
housings, zip ties, and a 15 pin Molex connector. Once on the handlebars, wires
were connected to header pins on the LCD and pushbuttons with Dupont
connectors.</p>
<p>Rearward of the Arduino, T-tap wire splices were used to cleanly splice power
signals from the NiCd battery above the Arduino near the top tube and from the
wheel speed sensor near the bottom bracket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electronics-housings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">5.3 Electronics Housings</a></h3>
<p>Housings for the Arduino Nano, pushbuttons and LCD were designed and 3D printed
to enclose the electrical components and mount them to the ebike. Figure 9,
below, shows the CAD model design of the Arduino housing. The housing’s design
includes pins for press fitting the Arduino stripboard to the mount. Slots on
the sides and top of the housing allow for wires to exit towards their
destinations on the ebike. Threaded inserts on the base are used to secure the
top cover using M3 screws.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Arduino Housing." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/ArduinoHousingDesign.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 9.  Arduino housing design.</em></p>

<p>This housing is clamped to the downtube of the ebike by a socket head screw as
shown in Figure 10.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 10. Arduino housing mounting point.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Both the LCD and button housings were 3D printed and designed to mount to the
handlebars using a clamshell style mount used for securing GoPro cameras to
bikes. Each mount had a pair of “bunny ears" designed to interface with the
GoPro style mount. The LCD housing, shown in Figure 11 below, is a simple
rectangular two-piece enclosure joined by button head screws.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="LCD Housing." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/LCDHousingDesign.jpg"/>
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 11. LCD housing design.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Similar to the LCD housing, the button housing is a two-piece, enclosure joined
by screws. Inside the housing is a small piece of stripboard that the
pushbuttons are soldered to. To make pressing the mini momentary pushbuttons
more convenient for the user, larger button parts were 3D printed and offset
from each mini momentary pushbutton using a compression spring as shown in
Figure 12 below.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">7.0 Lessons Learned and Suggested Improvements</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the process of implementing this controller, I learned some helpful
lessons when it comes to designing electronics  housings and doing electrical
hookups.</p>
<p>Some lessons learned include the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is important to account for the minimum bend radius of each wire inside of
an electrical enclosure</li>
<li>It is important to follow <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lulzbot.com/learn/tutorials/heat-set-inserts-tips-and-tricks">best practices</a>
when designing for heat set threaded inserts</li>
<li>Iteration is required in order to achieve a design intent when 3D printing</li>
<li>Test the assembly and function of electrical connections on scrap wire before
commiting changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the implementation of this design, I've made note of some
improvements to the system's design that could be made. I have listed these
below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A larger momentary pushbutton could be used to reduce the complexity of the
button housing and improve its functionality</li>
<li>Use a display that communicates via the SPI protocol to reduce the number of
wires used</li>
<li>For the Arduino board, use a custom PCB to increase the robustness of the
board</li>
</ul>
