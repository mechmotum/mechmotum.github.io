<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">1.0 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The overall goal of this project is to design and implement a cruise control
system for an instrumented ebike used for conducting bicycle handling
experiments. A previous blog post <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/blog/ebike-controller-design.html">(found here)</a> outlines the design and analysis of a
continuous time PID controller for controlling the speed of the ebike. This
blog post tells the story of how the designed PID controller was implemented
digitally on the instrumented ebike through an Arduino Nano and how it fits
into the ebike cruise control system that was developed to make functional use
of the PID controller.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-operation-functionality">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">2.0 System Operation &amp; Functionality</a></h2>
<p>The implementation of the cruise control system on the electric bike was
fundamentally informed by the interactions the user would have with the system.
A typical user interaction with the system is outlined in Figure 1 below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="User Interaction." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/UserInteractionFlowChart.jpg" style="width: 60%;" />
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 1. A typical user interaction with the system.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This user interaction flowchart was used to help better understand the problem
of implementing the cruise control system and sculpt the concepts for the
hardware and software portions of the cruise control system.</p>

<div class="section" id="control-architecture">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">3.1 Control Architecture</a></h3>
<p>The control architecture is a simple negative feedback design that computes the
error between a user defined setpoint and the actual speed of the ebike. Figure
2 graphically shows how the control architecture is implemented on the ebike.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-architecture">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">3.2 Physical Architecture</a></h3>
<p>At the heart of the cruise control system’s physical architecture is its
integration into the instrumented ebike’s powertrain. Figure 3 shows this
integration by highlighting the input/output and geometric relationships
between existing components of the ebike and the additional components needed
to implement the cruise control system.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="System Architecture." src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/ControlSystemGeometricLayout.jpg" style="width: 75%;" />
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 3. Geometric layout of the system components showing relative size,
location, information flow, and type of each component. Components called
out with a triangle are existing components on the ebike. Components called
out with a circle are components that are introduced to the ebike system to
implement the cruise control.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The fundamental interaction between the control system and the existing ebike
powertrain system occurs at the interface between the Arduino nano and the
ebike motor controller. While the cruise control is engaged, the function of
the Arduino is to take control of the throttle signal away from the user by
passing the calculated output of the control loop to the motor controller
instead of the throttle position commanded by the rider. When the cruise
control is disengaged, the Arduino simply reads the user commanded throttle
position and passes it directly to the motor controller. Figure 4, below,
graphically shows this interaction.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 4. Schematic showing the Arduino’s function as a throttle emulator.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>Note: Testing of the cruise control system has shown the implementation method
shown in Figure 4 to be inadequate while the cruise control is disengaged. The
time required for the Arduino to read and then write the signal it receives
from the throttle leads to unresponsive manual speed control while the cruise
control is disengaged. A fix to this issue is proposed in section 5.5 of this
blog post.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">4.0 Software</a></h2>
<p>The cruise control system software was written in C using the Arduino IDE.
Based on user inputs from two momentary pushbuttons, the software decides
whether or not to pass the throttle signal as an output or compute a throttle
output based on the PID controller. The software also updates the user on the
current status of the system via an LCD and logs diagnostic information to an
SD card.</p>
<p>Figure 5, below, shows a high level view of the logic flow of the code.</p>

<div class="section" id="code-libraries">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">4.1 Code Libraries</a></h3>
<p>The continuous time PID controller derived in part one of this blog post series
was digitized on the Arduino Nano using Brett Beauregard’s PID_v1 library
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library">(found here)</a>. This library
was developed by Brett to implement continuous time PID controllers on Arduino
microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Brett’s library was chosen to implement the PID controller because of its many
robust features such as Derivative Kick and Initialization. Additionally, this
library contains fantastic documentation which can be <a class="reference external" href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/">found here</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid slowing the code’s main loop, interrupts were used to manage the
change in setpoint brought on by a press of the speed increment decrement
buttons. Using interrupts free’s up the Arduino’s processor from having to
check whether or not there’s been a button press on every loop iteration.
Instead, the processor reacts to pin changes and interrupts the execution of
the main code to perform the function tied to the interrupt pin. However, the
Arduino Nano only has a limited number of pins that can be used as interrupts.
A library, written by GreyGnome <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GreyGnome/PinChangeInt">(found here)</a>, enables the use of interrupts
on any pin of the Arduino Nano. This library was used to free up pin real
estate for the many components that are wired up to the Arduino.</p>

converted to an ebike with a conversion kit sold by Amped Bikes. The Amped
Bikes kit consists of a brushless direct drive hub motor driven by a motor

<p>The Arduino Nano and the voltage divider circuits were soldered to a small 3&quot; x
1&quot; piece of protoboard. Wires (22 AWG) were soldered to the protoboard to
connect the external components to the Nano. Figure 7 shows the completed
Arduino board.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 7. The Arduino board with wires attached.</em></p>
</div>
<p>With many of the components located on the handlebars, a majority of these
wires were routed together along the top tube, up the head tube and stretched
across to the handlebars. This task was facilitated using spiral wound cable
housings, zip ties, and a 15 pin Molex connector. Once on the handlebars, wires
were connected to header pins on the LCD and pushbuttons with Dupont
connectors.</p>
<p>T-tap wire splices were used to cleanly splice power signals from the NiCd
battery above the Arduino near the top tube and from the wheel speed sensor
near the bottom bracket.</p>
<p>A complete wiring schematic of the cruise control system can be found on the
laboratorium’s github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/eBikeSpdController">here</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="electronics-housings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">5.3 Electronics Housings</a></h3>
<p>Housings for the Arduino Nano, pushbuttons and LCD were designed and 3D printed
to enclose the electrical components and mount them to the ebike. Figure 8
shows the CAD model design of the Arduino housing. The housing’s design
includes pins for press fitting the Arduino stripboard to the mount. Slots on
the sides and top of the housing allow for wires to exit towards their
destinations on the ebike. Threaded inserts on the base are used to secure the
top cover using M3 screws.</p>

<p>The Arduino housing is clamped to the downtube of the ebike by a socket head
screw as shown in Figure 9.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 9. Arduino housing mounting point.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Both the LCD and button housings were 3D printed and designed to mount to the
handlebars using a clamshell style mount used for securing GoPro cameras to
bikes. Each mount had a pair of “bunny ears&quot; designed to interface with the
GoPro style mount. The LCD housing, shown in Figure 10 below, is a simple
rectangular two-piece enclosure joined by button head screws.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 10. LCD housing design.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Similar to the LCD housing, the button housing is a two-piece, enclosure joined
by screws. Inside the housing is a small piece of protoboard that the
pushbuttons are soldered to. To make pressing the mini momentary pushbuttons
more convenient for the user, larger button parts were 3D printed and offset
from each mini momentary pushbutton using a compression spring as shown in
Figure 11 below.</p>

<div class="section" id="dead-mans-switch">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">5.4 Dead Man’s Switch</a></h3>
<p>For safety reasons, a dead man’s switch was added to the cruise control system.
The dead man’s switch works by cutting power from the Li+ battery through a
mechanical relay. The relay’s coil is connected to a power circuit having a
Reed switch. The Reed switch is actuated by a magnet strapped to the rider’s
ankle. If the rider were to remove their ankle from the foot peg, separating
the ankle magnet from the Reed switch, power to relay’s coil would be
interrupted, opening the Li+ battery circuit. Sheet five of the master
electrical schematic shows how the switch is wired up to the ebike’s
powertrain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throttle-relay-planned">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">5.5 Throttle Relay (Planned)</a></h3>
<p>Currently, when cruise control is disengaged, the time it takes the Arduino to
read the throttle signal and then write it to the motor controller is leading
to a jerky ride. This is likely due to the intermittency in the throttle signal
output to the motor controller produced by the delay in reading and writing the
throttle signal through the Arduino. Placing a relay in line with the throttle
signal will provide a continuous signal flow to the motor controller by
eliminating the need to read and then write that signal when it passes through
the Arduino. A continuous signal flow will eliminate the intermittency issues
that make the bike feel jerky when the cruise control is disengaged.</p>
<p>Current plans for the relay have it placed inline with the throttle signal wire
and switched by the Arduino through its digital write function. The proposed
changes to the wiring schematic and software can be found on the project’s
Github repository under the “relay” branch. Plans for the physical
implementation of the relay include placing the relay on a piece of protoboard
mounted to the bike’s top tube,inside the upper head tube triangle.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-15">7.0 Suggested Improvements</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the implementation of this design, I've made note of some
improvements to the system's hardware design that could be made to address
known issues. I have listed these below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a display that communicates via the SPI protocol to reduce the number of
wires used</li>
<li>For the Arduino board, use a custom PCB and connectors to increase the
robustness of the board</li>
<li>Implement a throttle relay (See section 5.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some avenues for improving the accuracy and precision of the cruise
control:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Set a faster sampling time in the PID Arduino library</li>
<li>Replace DC generator wheel speed sensor with a rotary encoder for smoother
speed input (and preservation of the rear tire)</li>
<li>Experiment with manual PID parameter tuning during outdoor testing to improve
output surging while cruise control is engaged</li>
</ul>
