<p>We have developed an optimization algorithm that can discover bicycle designs
which maximize the lateral handling qualities of the vehicle <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. The
algorithm produces less-than-intuitive but physically feasible bicycle designs.
We are currently working to make the algorithm more robust and expand the
parameter search space. We are also constructing some of the discovered designs
for experimental validation and testing.</p>

<p>We have proposed a theoretical lateral handling quality metric for any given
bicycle design based on a corpus of experimental data in aircraft handling
research <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id3">[2]</a>. This project aims to validate this metric directly from
experimental evidence in bicycling maneuvers and tasks. We have developed a
variable stability instrumented bicycle and demonstrated preliminarily that
that there may be correlations between our theoretical metric and the rider's
subjective opinion of the bicycle's handling <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id4">[3]</a>. Ongoing work includes,
improvements to the experimental apparatus and protocol for a larger scale
validation with arbitrary experimental subjects.</p>

<p>Analysis of comprehensive dynamical data during bicycling trips and activities
has the potential to teach us much about travel behavior and safety of
bicyclists. We would like to develop a open collaborative project with the aim
of creating a modular, continually inexpensive, open source, and open hardware

<h3>Control Identification of Human Standing</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Current researchers: Erich Baur</div>
<div class="line">Collaborators: Ton van den Bogert (Cleveland State University)</div>
</div>
<p>Humans unconsciously utilize a control strategy while standing. Visual,
vestibular, and proprioceptive sensing inform the brain's control strategy
which reacts to internally and environmentally produced perturbations. This is
something humans are very good at but robots are bad at, thus if we can
understand how humans accomplish this we can potentially design robots with
biomimetic controllers. In laboratory settings we can accurately measure body
segment kinematics, muscle activation levels, and ground force reactions during
standing. Given all or subsets of this data collected during externally
perturbed standing, we are interested in developing optimal control theories
and methods of identifying the specific control strategy in use. We have
developed parameter identification methods using direct collocation to identify
the controllers used in simulated standing <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id9">[4]</a>. The general optimal control
and parameter estimation methods used have been formalized in the software,
Opty <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id10">[5]</a>. We are currently developing a small desktop &quot;double pendulum on a
cart&quot; robot to verify and improve the control identification methods. The robot
will allow us to measure the motion during perturbed balancing which is a
result of known programmed control strategies.</p>

<p>Real-time feedback of stroke-by-stroke rowing performance metrics can enable
data driven training and coaching. Instrumenting rowers during training and
competition with laboratory quality sensing is very difficult, but the ubiquity
of smartphones provides an avenue to collect fewer and less accurate kinematic
and kinetic measurements. This project aims to improve performance critical
biomechanic rowing metrics through dynamics informed estimation algorithms. We
have developed rower adaptive filtering methods to predict global boat
position, speed, stroke rate, and distance per stroke at high accuracy and with
experimental protocols for validating the estimations.</p>

<p>Little engineering or science goes into the design and construction of ski and
snowboard jumps in terrain parks at publicly accessible ski resorts. A
relatively large number of injuries and even deaths occur during skiing and
snowboarding at these resorts. It is possible to design the landing surfaces of
jumps such that the normal impact velocity on landing is capped at a safer
value regardless of the jumper's takeoff speed and jump launch speed. These
jump designs can still provide large maximum heights and flight durations. We
have designed a web application that laymen can use to design ski jumps with a
specified equivalent fall height.</p>

</div>
<p>&quot;Computational thinking&quot; is an alternative learning process for formulating and
solving engineering problems. A unique set of abstractions are available to the
learner in addition to those from mathematical and written language. We have
developed an interactive textbook and problem sets using the Jupyter system of
tools for 40 hours of in-class teaching and learning. These teaching materials
are backed by a custom software library for mechanical vibrations designed to
facilitate solving problems with computational thinking.</p>

<div class="line">Current researchers: Jashanpreet Singh</div>
<div class="line">Collaborators: Ashirant and other SymPy Developers</div>
<div class="line">Past researchers: Sampad Saha</div>
</div>
<p>Mechanical and civil engineers utilize two- and three-dimensional theories of
stress and strain to determine if structural beams will fail. Simple
mathematical models can be used to make accurate predictions of failure due to
shear, bending, and torsion stresses and due to deflection. Solving beam
related problems typically involves integrating discontinuous functions and
solving for boundary conditions. The integral calculus and algebra details
often hide the trees for the woods. This project is centered around developing
a package for SymPy that can be used to model and solve analytical beam
problems, without getting bogged down in the mathematical details.</p>

<p>We have developed a inexpensive centrifugal pump that attaches to a simple

centrifugal pump paired with power generation from cycling will be overall more
efficient than a more efficient positive displacement pump paired with stepping
power generation. We are accurately measuring the input biomechanical power and
output hydraulic power from both systems to produce efficiency curves as a
function of hydraulic load.</p>
