<h2>MSc General</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We expect you to take the lead in your project. Your supervisors are here to
advise and guide you, but it is up to you to manage your time, relationships,
work, etc.</li>
<li>BME and BMD MSc students now have some new excellent guidance documents with
flowcharts available on the &quot;Master Biomedical Engineering&quot; and &quot;Master
Biomechanical Design&quot; Brightspace courses under &quot;Flowcharts &amp; Guidance Docs&quot;.
Please read these and reference them regularly. The guide here is a
compliment to those documents.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to join the &quot;Graduation Community Program&quot; for get-
togethers and workshops on topics to help you move through your MSc. This is
especially helpful if you are struggling in your MSc.</li>
<li>You have to write at least three documents for your MSc. Read the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-writing.html">writing
guide</a> for tips and expectations.</li>
<li>Review the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-data-management.html">Data Management Guide</a> to learn how to handle your
data.</li>
<li>If you are doing experiments, review the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-experimentation.html">Experimentation Guide</a>.</li>

<div class="section" id="internship">
<h2>Internship</h2>
<p>15 ECs (420 hours, ~10 weeks full time)</p>
<p>After you have found an internship, typically on your own but sometimes through
postings via the lab, here are some things you need to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review the Study Guide explanation of your internship, for example:<ul>
<li>BMD: <a class="reference external" href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456">https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456</a></li>
<li>BME: <a class="reference external" href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534">https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review the internship forms and guidelines (always use up-to-date forms):
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms</a></li>
<li>Fill out the MSc internship initiation form with your project description and
other relevant information. Develop this project idea with your internship
company/org contacts. If you think this aligns with Jason's research
interests or the internship came through the bike lab you can send the form
to Jason and ask him to be your TUD advisor. If he agrees, then you can
obtain his signature on the form and forward it to your respective MSc
coordinator.</li>
<li>Make all of your internship arrangements yourself with the company (travel,
stipend, housing, IP, NDA, etc.). Reach out to your TUD supervisor if you
need help in any of these aspects.</li>
<li>To receive academic credit for your internship at the end you need to write a
report and have it assessed by your TUD internship supervisor. The short
report should contain aspects aligned with those described in this rubric:
<a class="reference external" href="https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf">https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf</a>
and the direction and needs of your external internship supervisor. This
rubric will not be used to determine your grade, it is simply pass/fail based
on the supervisor's review.</li>
<li>You also need your external internship supervisor to fill out the form
&quot;INTERNSHIP ASSESSMENT FORM FOR EXTERNAL PARTIES&quot; and submit the completed
version to your TUD supervisor.</li>
<li>Note that your TUD supervisor is typically not involved in your internship
other than the signing the initial form and assessing and providing a grade
at the end. The purpose of the internship is for you to get some non-academic
experience in engineering. The internship should also be distinct from your
MSc literature study and thesis project in the sense that a standalone report
for the internship work is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some companies and organizations that have hosted internships with us
in the past: Gazelle, Prinoth, Garmin/Tacx, Swugo, B-Cells, Team DSM, SymPy,
Bikefitting.com, TrueKinetix, velolab.de, TU Delft Sports Engineering
Institute, Aalborg University Sports Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="literature-study">
<h2>Literature Study</h2>
<p>10 ECs (280 hours, ~7 weeks full time)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are a BMD or BME student, read the relevant guidance docs found on
Brightspace.</li>
<li>Arrange an initial meeting with your supervisor(s) to discuss how to get
started on the literature study and to discuss the general topic area of the
study.</li>
<li>Review the &quot;MSc Literature Review Assessment Rubric&quot; on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/msc-forms/">3mE MSc Forms</a>
page.</li>
<li>Read &quot;How to read a paper&quot; and &quot;Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Literature
Review&quot; and review the &quot;The Literature Review Process&quot; website in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide.html#recommended-reading">recommended reading section</a>.</li>
<li>Choose and learn a tool/method to organize your papers and notes (e.g.
Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote, Excel).</li>
<li>The first goal is to read a large quantity of paper abstracts (phase 1 in
&quot;How to Read a Paper&quot;) to get a broad sense of what people are researching
about the topics of interest.</li>
<li>The second goal is to formulate a research question(s) that you can likely
answer with the papers you read.</li>
<li>Once you have a research question in mind, arrange a meeting with your
supervisors to formally present the question and receive feedback (this
should occur within the first two weeks of work). You should prepare a slide
presentation or similar to help communicate this.</li>
<li>The third goal is to delve deep into papers that are closely related to your
research question, analyze and critique them, and synthesize the knowledge
you obtain from them into a coherent answer to you research question.</li>
<li>Before writing your report read &quot;The Science of Scientific Writing&quot; and &quot;How
to write a good (enough) report&quot; in the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide.html#recommended-reading">recommend reading section</a>.</li>
<li>Lastly, write up your findings for a technical audience in a way that answers
your research question.</li>
<li>Once you have a first full draft of the literature study, request feedback
from your supervisors. This usually takes a week. You can arrange a meeting
to receive verbal feedback also. Use the feedback to improve your document
and then submit it to your supervisors for their official assessment and
grade.</li>
<li>For BMD students, as you approach the finish of your literature study you
should schedule your colloquium, where you will present the results of your
literature study to your peers. We encourage you to practice your colloquium
with an ad hoc group from the lab or at a lab meeting. Send an invite to your
colloquium to the lab.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="msc-thesis">
<h2>MSc Thesis</h2>
<p>35 ECs (980 hours, ~25 weeks full time)</p>
<p>Basic Steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Submit MSc initiation form (BME/BMD form 4, other tracks may have a different
form). You may do this at the start of your literature study, if appropriate.</li>
<li>Formulate a research question or hypothesis that you'd like address in
consultation with your supervisors (this usually occurs in the later portion
of your literature study period and is informed by your literature study
findings).</li>
<li>Develop a written project plan (3 pages) and submit it to your supervisor(s)
before the kickoff meeting so they have time to read it. The plan should
address:<ul>
<li>your research question/aim/goals</li>
<li>your basic technical approach to answer the research question or achieve
you design (include your proposed methods, simulations, analyses, models,
sketches, experimental methods, etc.)</li>
<li>a timeline that includes major milestones with dates, your expected holiday
time, and a buffer for delays</li>
<li>what resources you will likely need for the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize a kickoff meeting with all of your supervisors to formally present
your research project and project plan. This should be slide presentation or
similar.</li>
<li>Adjust your project plan based on the feedback at the kickoff meeting.</li>
<li>Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.</li>
<li>Present your progress at a midterm meeting with a formal presentation and
with all of your supervisors present. The midterm should occur after you have
significant preliminary results that demonstrate you can succeed in the final
project execution.</li>
<li>Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.</li>
<li>Once you are getting close to a draft thesis arrange a Go/No-Go meeting. This
meeting should include all of your supervisors that will be on your defense
committee except the &quot;external independent member&quot;. Typically give the
supervisors one week to read and comment on the draft before the meeting.
Prepare a (strictly) 10 minute slide presentation to get everyone up to speed
at the beginning of the meeting.</li>
<li>If you get a &quot;Go&quot; at the Go/No-Go meeting then you should initiate the
arrangement of your defense by submitting the correct forms to your track
coordinators and department secretaries.</li>
<li>If you get a &quot;No-Go&quot;, at the Go/No-Go meeting then take the supervisors'
feedback and improve your work until you are ready for another Go/No-Go
meeting.</li>
<li>When you have a &quot;Go&quot;, edit your thesis based on the supervisors' feedback.
When you have a final version of your thesis, send it to your supervisors two
weeks before the defense and submit it to the TU Delft Education Repository.
Make sure to add an embargo if your work requires one.</li>
<li>Follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-data-management.html">Data Management Guide</a> and deliver your project
assets to the lab principle investigator and any partner organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always use up-to-date forms from here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me%E2%80%90student%E2%80%90portal/education/related/student%E2%80%90forms/msc%E2%80%90forms/">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me%E2%80%90student%E2%80%90portal/education/related/student%E2%80%90forms/msc%E2%80%90forms/</a></li>
<li>If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
sensitive information you will need to arrange the &quot;Graduation Agreement at a
Company&quot; that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
here here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/">https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/</a>.
Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.</li>
