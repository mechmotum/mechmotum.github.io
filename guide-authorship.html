    <p>Credit as an author is one of the primary currencies for recognition and
advancement in academia. People often seek authorship in academia with similar
fervor that people seek money in daily life. This means that assigning
authorship may not always be easy. There are also different customs in
different research fields when assigning authorship. It behooves you to learn
about this nuanced activity we must navigate when working in academia. The
Wikipedia article on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_authorship">Academic Authorship</a> gives a starting point and you may
find it (not) amusing to read the <a class="reference external" href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/authorship?tab=Votes">Academia Stack Exchange posts on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>For officially and unofficially published works that members of the bicycle lab
produce which have an author list where Jason plays a role as an advisor or
supervisor, the guidelines below should be followed. If Jason is not involved
in that role, you should follow whatever guidelines and custom your authorship
team follows.</p>
<div class="section" id="definitions">
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>First Author</dt>
<dd>This generally should be the person that did most of the physical and
intellectual labor for the content of the written work. If it isn't, there
should be a very good reason.</dd>
<dt>Lead Author</dt>
<dd>Typically the person who initiates and leads the production of the written
work. This is usually one person and they are responsible for the official
submission of the manuscript somewhere. This is most often the first author,
but need not be.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customs">
<h2>Customs</h2>
<p>In mechanical engineering,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is customary to list the person that made the primary contribution and did
the majority of the physical and intellectual labor as the first author.</li>
<li>If an immediate advisor/supervisor of a student, PhD candidate, or Postdoc is
a co-author on the manuscript, they are customarily listed last. This is
because promotion judgement committees look for professors' last author
listing as a sign of leadership.</li>
<li>It is unclear if there is any common way the intermediate authors are
ordered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guidelines">
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your thesis or dissertation is a single author document. The purpose of this
document is to demonstrate that you can create such a document by yourself
with only guidance from your advisors and peers. In essence, you write every
single sentence and produce every single figure and no one else would write
any sentences.</li>
<li>If your thesis or dissertation includes one or more papers that have
co-authorship, then you have to explain clearly in the thesis or dissertation
what your individual contributions are. The <a class="reference external" href="https://credit.niso.org/">CRediT</a> system is a helpful
framework for doing so. In principle, you should only include papers you are
first author on, unless there is some special circumstance. Co-authors must
consent to you including the paper in your thesis or dissertation.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">ICMJE</a> recommends authorship be based on four criteria and we use these
criteria as our foundation for assigning authorship (quoted here):<ol class="arabic">
<li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the
acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND</li>
<li>Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual
content; AND</li>
<li>Final approval of the version to be published; AND</li>
<li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that
questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are
appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When you lead a co-authored manuscript you should discuss with each person
that may make or may have made substantial contributions to see if they
desire to be a co-author. There is no hard definition of what &quot;substantial
contributions&quot; universally means, so this boils down to an interpersonal
negotiation where the lead author has the responsibility to make things fair
to the best of their ability.</li>
<li>Explicitly propose the author order and get all authors agreement on it. If
there is disagreement, the lead author should facilitate an agreement.</li>
<li>Once you have negotiated the list of authors, they all must then do points
2., 3., and 4. in the ICJME criteria list to be confirmed as authors.</li>
<li>You should never submit a manuscript to any publishing venue without the
consent of all authors and agreement on points 1-4. It is the lead author's
responsibility to give enough time for points 1-4 to be worked out. If
reasonable time and deadlines have been given, and co-authors do not meet
1-4, they should be moved to the acknowledgements section of the paper. This
should likely never be done for a journal paper due to its importance, but
for less consequential things, like an abstract, it may be fine.</li>
<li>It is perfectly fine to do projects and write papers without the involvement
of Jason. Please do that! He should not be co-author on papers where he
didn't meet points 1-4 even if he obtained your funding or is simply your
supervisor. Of course, he loves to be invited for topics he is interested in
and has time to contribute.</li>
