<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Motivations</strong></p>
<p>Bicycle dynamics — particularly their tendency to exhibit unstable vibration
modes such as wobble — is strongly inner controlled, repeatable conditions.
This project aims to fill that gap by developing a stabilized treadmill-based
test setup paired with a parametric bicycle, enabling targeted investigation of
how stiffness modulates the stability of intrinsic dynamic modes — including
wobble influenced by the stiffness of structural components. Wobble,
characterized by oscillation of the front assembly about the steering axis, is
a well-documented instability that can compromise safety and handling. While
prior bicycle research has explored (mostly) numerically its dependence on
geometry, tire properties, and rider effect, few studies have systematically
isolated the effect of component stiffness.</p>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>
<p>A custom parametric bicycle — featuring adjustable frame geometry (top tube,
fork length, steering and fork angles) and tunable structural stiffness — was
mounted on a stabilized treadmill to eliminate rider-induced variability.
Synchronized gyroscopes were mounted on the front assembly to capture
rotational motion. Tests were conducted at low velocities across multiple
stiffness configurations, allowing direct observation of how changes in
rigidity affect modal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Recorded motion signals were analyzed using signal processing and linear
stability methods. The stability and frequency of dominant modes — notably the
wobble mode — were evaluated as functions of stiffness and velocity.
Statistical validation was performed via ANOVA to assess the significance of
observed trends. The goal was to establish a reliable, repeatable framework for
studying how component-level properties shape global vehicle dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Main results</strong></p>
<p>Two distinct vibration modes were identified, both occurring at lower
frequencies than typically reported — consistent with the reduced stiffness and
lower test velocities employed. Crucially, the relationship between stiffness,
velocity, and mode stability aligned with theoretical expectations: increased
stiffness and/or velocity tended to stabilize the wobble mode, while lower
values promoted instability. The treadmill setup proved highly effective in
enabling controlled, rider-free experimentation — offering a robust platform
for future parametric studies of bicycle dynamics.</p>
<p>This work provides a foundational methodology for investigating how component
stiffness shapes the stability of intrinsic dynamic modes — a critical step
toward designing safer, more predictable bicycles.</p>
