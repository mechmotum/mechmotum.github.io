<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Motivations</strong></p>
<p>This research is part of an effort to improve the safety of cyclists in their
daily mobility in urban environments. It focuses on the cognitive load of
cyclists when navigating a complex environment that requires constant
interaction between the infrastructure and other road users. With limited
information processing and control capabilities for handling a vehicle,
cognitive overload is known to be a factor that compromises safety (associated
with poorer decision-making and potential loss of control). For this reason,
studying the cognitive load of cyclists is relevant to their safety.</p>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>
<p>This experimental study consisted of measuring the cognitive load of cyclists
while riding their bikes in natural urban traffic conditions in the city of
Delft (Netherlands). The collection of this information was accompanied by
position measurement (using GPS), head movement measurement (using IMU), eye
movement measurement (using eye tracking glasses), and video measurement from a
first-person perspective. This data collection is unique in that it combines a
subjective measurement of cognitive load in real time with objective
measurements in an uncontrolled environment over several days with multiple
participants.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The data analysis consisted of two phases. First, we studied cognitive load
indicators derived from eye movements, which are well known in the literature
in more controlled measurement environments. The objective was to see whether
these indicators were also sensitive to cognitive load in uncontrolled
environments. The same approach was taken with new indicators based on head and
bicycle kinematics. The second phase of the data analysis was to build machine
learning models capable of predicting a cyclist's cognitive load at any given
moment based on a few objective measurements. This type of algorithm could be
very useful for monitoring the cognitive load of cyclists on a large scale in
order to assess traffic conditions or the quality of infrastructure. This tool
would be useful for infrastructure research.</p>
<p><strong>Main results</strong></p>
<p>The results indicate that cognitive load indicators based on eye movement are
mostly sensitive to workload in uncontrolled environments, but their variations
are not very specific, making their predictive capabilities weak.  Combining
indicators from different measurement modalities has therefore proven to be a
powerful way to improve the predictive capabilities of machine learning
algorithms. These algorithms have shown remarkable generalization capabilities,
even if their predictive performance remains limited. The main result of this
analysis is that bicycle kinematics is a resilient source of information for
predicting cyclists' workload. This is based in particular on the fact that
cyclists exhibit task difficulty homeostasis behavior, in which they modulate
their speed to control their workload.</p>
<p><strong>Code and data</strong></p>
<p>The code and dataset for this project will be published very soon in open access.

<p>The data was collected as part of the final bachelor's degree project of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Jur Nelissen (Investigation, Methodology)</li>
<li>Tim Janssen (Investigation, Methodology)</li>
<li>Alex Mampuya (Investigation, Methodology)</li>
<li>Vince Opsteeg (Investigation, Methodology)</li>
</ul>
<p>These four students produced a robust and substantial piece of work that will
directly benefit research into cyclist safety.</p>
<p><strong>Future research</strong></p>
<p>This 12-month project deserves to be continued in order to consolidate the
cognitive load prediction models. So far, we have demonstrated the concept and
shown what type of method could be used to develop a monitoring tool that can
be used to map urban spaces. It would be particularly interesting to continue
using metrics based on vehicle kinematics, which are easy to measure and highly
predictive.</p>
