      <p>This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describe how
the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for on-boarding new members, but is
also a reference for current members. For this page to be useful, all lab
members will need to provide their collective knowledge and experiences.</p>
<div class="section" id="open-science">
<h2>Open Science</h2>
<p>The default science and engineering practice should be open practices (open
access publications, open source software, open data, etc). If unsure whether
to make information public, ask, otherwise please default to sharing early and
often. We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human
subject data, FERPA protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check
with the involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is
something that should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aio-weekly-emails">
<h2>AIO Weekly Emails</h2>
<p>Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to the lab group email list and any
collaborators each week.</p>
<p>&quot;AIO&quot; stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,</li>
<li>what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally</li>
<li>what your objectives are for the coming week.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should send it to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com">mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com</a> and cc anyone not in the lab
that is involved in your project.</p>
<p>The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with me, anyone involved
in your project outside the lab, and also to share among the lab members. The
latter is the most important one, because many of you may be solving similar
problems and can offer help/tips to other members. Doing this will hopefully
start conversations among the group. Some notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.</li>
<li>No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.</li>
<li>The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.</li>
<li>It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
suggestion so everyone can learn.</li>
<li>This is not a contest. I don't care how much you accomplish, but I do care
that you are working and attempting to make progress. If you had vacation
that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just note that.</li>
<li>If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
reader to understand the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the PI. It can be before
(we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the issues with
me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post meeting.
However you do it, each week the accomplishments should hopefully reflect the
objectives you wrote the previous week.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-email-list">
<h2>Lab Email List</h2>
<p>When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum</a></p>
<p>This is both an announcement list and a discussion list for the lab. All lab
members need to join and pay attention to this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-hired">
<h2>Getting Hired</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Undergraduate Research Assistant</dt>
<dd>Undergraduate research assistants must contact the MAE office and sign some
paperwork (patent agreement, etc).</dd>
<dt>Volunteer Research Assistant</dt>
<dd>Volunteer researchers must fill out a volunteer form and sign the UCD patent
agreement at the MAE office before starting work.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-hours">
<h2>Logging Hours</h2>
<p>Paid lab employees must sign into the <a class="reference external" href="https://trs.ucdavis.edu/trs/">hour logging system</a> every two weeks to
submit their work hours for review. If you worked 0 hours for the time period
you still need to submit a time sheet with 0 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safety-training">
<h2>Safety Training</h2>
<p>Anyone who works with me in a non-class related project must take the MAE
Safety Fundamental class (ideally) before working. Contact Loan-Anh Nguygen
for the next offering and to discuss your specific safety needs.</p>
<p>Anyone who works in a lab space (non-office) and works with physical equipment
must take the online Lab Safety Fundamentals course.</p>
<p>Anyone who works in a lab space must take the site specific training offered by
that lab manager. This includes the EDSC.</p>
<p>If you are a volunteer, non-undergraduate employee, haven't taken EME 50, or
are a graduate student that did not attend UC Davis as an undergrad, you must
take the 8 week EDSC orientation course before you can use the shop. Check with
the shop on about the schedule for these.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="purchasing">
<h2>Purchasing</h2>
<p>See the EME 185 purchasing guidelines for logistics (for now):</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/resources.html#purchasing-parts-and-materials">http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/resources.html#purchasing-parts-and-materials</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-management">
<h2>Reference Management</h2>
<p>The lab has a shared <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum">mechmotum group</a>. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control">
<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>The currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control of
text based sources (software, text, etc):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/mechmotum">https://gitlab.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/">https://github.com/mechmotum/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The services are more or less interchangeable. The primary reason to use Gitlab
is if you need a private repository, as it offers those for free. You may
prefer the features of one service over the other.</p>
<p>Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Git lesson</a> is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-website">
<h2>Lab Website</h2>
<p>The lab website is a <a class="reference external" href="getpelican.com">Pelican</a> based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io">https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io</a></p>
<p>Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="research-ideas">
<h2>Research Ideas</h2>
<p>Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues">https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-inventory">
<h2>Lab Inventory</h2>
<p>There is a common spreadsheet on google drive that lab members should use to
track our non-consumbable inventory (tools, devices, expensive stuff,
computers, 3D printing spools in the EDSC, etc). Anytime you buy something add
it to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be accessed at this link:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w80SolpcLTbLtuFDIf9-F-sS_pO-1PEHSpSgEGH_SSg/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w80SolpcLTbLtuFDIf9-F-sS_pO-1PEHSpSgEGH_SSg/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
