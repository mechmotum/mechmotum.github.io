<p>This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it to do so. Discuss with the
lab any desires to change any of the guidelines.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Join the lab communication channels: Ask Jason &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:j.k.moore&#64;tudelft.nl">j.k.moore&#64;tudelft.nl</a>&gt; to add
you to the lab <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/mechmotum">email list</a> and someone in the lab how to join the lab's
element/matrix chat room or read the instrutions in the Google Drive &quot;How to
join the Element/Matrix chat room&quot;.</li>
<li>Send an introduction email to the lab email list
(<a class="reference external" href="mailto:mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com">mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com</a>): who you are, a bit about yourself, what you
will work on, etc.</li>
<li>Add your name and portrait to the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/members.html">lab members page</a> by sending a PNG or JPG
300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.</li>
<li>Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
recommendations.</li>
<li>Attend biweekly <a class="reference external" href="#laboratory-meetings">lab meetings</a>. Ask a lab member for
the calendar invite with the video chat link.</li>
<li>Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
needed). These can be requested from Jason by sending him an email with your
student ID number, TU Delft email address, and expected duration of access.
Ask for a tour of the space from a current lab member before you start
working there.</li>
<li>Request access to the lab's shared Google Drive from Jason.</li>
<li>Request to be added to the Github lab team organization: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum">https://github.com/mechmotum</a>.</li>
<li>We have the optional &quot;Cheese for Thought&quot; lunch every Wednesday at 12:00,
meet at the lab. This is a chance to discuss topics informally or have some
good weather fun.</li>
<li>Every month we have a Friday afternoon lab tidying session at 16:30 and we go
for snacks and drinks (Vrijmibo) in Delft on Fridays &#64; 17:00.</li>
<li>See the <a class="reference external" href="#recommended-reading">recommended reading list</a> below for some

<div class="section" id="employees">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Employees</a></h2>
<p>Postdocs, PhDs, and other staff</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You are expected to attend the lab meetings and other common lab work
sessions (e.g. lab cleanup) unless you are sick or on holiday.</li>
<li>You are expected to spend some of your time to help Jason manage and organize
the lab and research group. In particular, you should help improve and
maintain the website, help tidy, organize, and clean the lab space, keep
physical equipment maintained and running. PhDs and Postdocs should take on
at least one lab role and help with the other roles' tasks.</li>
<li>If you are not able to work at standard capacity, you must take sick leave or
holiday leave.</li>
<li>If you need to take sick leave, report this to your immediate supervisor and
the secretariat when you become sick. When you return, also inform your
immediate supervisor and secretariat. Make sure your sick leave hours are
logged in TIM.</li>
<li>All holiday time has to be requested via TIM and approved by the department
manager. You must take your holiday time before the end of your contract.
Note that you can sell some holiday time (up to 38 hrs/year via IKA). If you
decide to take a holiday please inform Jason by email so he is aware
you are unavailable and can mark it on his calendar. If you are going to take a
week or more at a time, please inform your supervisor well in advance for
planning purposes so we can cover any of your duties.</li>
<li>TU Delft's policy is that you can work from home 2 days per week if your
supervisor approves. The other 3 days should be on campus. You have Jason's
blanket permission to work from home or other locations the equivalent of 2
days per week. If you want to work from home more that this, discuss with
Jason. You should, in general, complete your contracted work hours during
typical working hours 8-6 so that you can interact with the lab members. When
you work from home you should be easily reachable by email, phone, or video
chat, etc. during these hours. There is no expectation that you are available
outside standard work hours or that you have to respond to email, calls,
chats, etc. although occasionally there are emergencies and your flexibility
is appreciated.</li>
<li>You likely have a budget associated with your position or projects. Ask Jason
or the relevant supervisor to tell you this budget. You can mange your own
budget and don't need to ask permission for purchasing things &lt; 250 EUR. If
you need to spend more than that, then inform your immediate supervisor of
the purchase before purchasing so there are no surprises. The secretariat can
purchase items for you or you can purchase items and request reimbursement.</li>
<li>Work related travel outside of the Netherlands must be pre approved via
Digiforms and pre-approved by Jason.</li>
<li>Postdocs will have an annual review with your supervisors (R&amp;O). These should
occur in the first quarter of the year. It is up to you to make sure this is
scheduled. PhDs follow the graduate school review process and do not have
R&amp;O's.</li>
<li>Postdocs may use 20% of their contracted time to pursue their academic and
career endeavors not related to their contracted work, e.g. finishing papers
from their PhD or gaining teaching experience, given that progress on your
contracted project is satisfactory. Discuss workload with Jason if you are
not able to take advantage of this as you desire and we will do our best to
make this possible, but this is mostly dependent on your ability to be
efficient with your primary research tasks.</li>
<li>If you supervise BSc, MSc, or PhD students that regularly use the lab
resources and/or Jason is the main supervisor of, those students need to
follow join the Bicycle Lab and follow the expectations in this guide.</li>
<li>If you have multiple supervisors, you will need to merge their expectations
and policies with Jason's. Discuss with your supervisors if there are
incompatibilities.</li>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Lab Email List</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum</a></p>
<p class="last">This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion. Write to the
email list by sending a message to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com">mechmotum&#64;googlegroups.com</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Text, Audio, Video Chat Room</dt>
<dd>We host a <a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> server which can be accessed using <a class="reference external" href="https://element.io">https://element.io</a> or
any other supported <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum">clients</a>. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
There are a number of rooms that you can join where we share papers,
conference announcements, etc.</dd>
<dt>Issue Trackers</dt>
<dd><p class="first">We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communicate.
This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
repository (in addition to the website issues):</p>

</dd>
<dt>Blog Posts</dt>
<dd>In general, we would like each project to write at least one blog post for
the lab website. This post should at least describe project results. This
writing exercise will help build the content for future papers and theses
and provide outreach to the public about our work. If you write more than
one blog post, it is helpful to do these on a schedule (quarterly,
semi-annually, etc.). If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll
need to select aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo
the blog post to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.</dd>

<div class="section" id="lab-roles">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Lab Roles</a></h2>
<p>We collectively keep the lab (both metaphysical and physical) running,
organized, and useful for all. To do so, we designate responsibility for
several task groups to individuals and it is their role to take responsibility
for those tasks.  This does not mean they have to do all tasks in a role, so
they will have to leverage lab members and university resources to help keeping
things running. Lab roles rotate and you should at least do a role for a
quarter. Postdocs and PhDs should take more responsibility than MSc students,
in general. It is important that role activities are public and documented so
the role can be passed on to a new person will minimal disturbance.</p>
<p>We <em>all</em> manage the lab tasks on the Github housekeeping issue list (do not put
any personal information there as it is public):</p>

<div class="section" id="laboratory-meetings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Laboratory Meetings</a></h2>
<p>We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have two designated people
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.</p>
<p>The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&lt;10 minute presentation with Q &amp; A</li>
<li>tutorial</li>
<li>have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)</li>
<li>watch and discuss a video</li>
<li>invite a speaker</li>
<li>play a game</li>
<li>practice your colloquia or conference talks</li>
<li>bicycle-themed stand-up</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.</p>
<p>The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://mechmotum.github.io/guide-how-to-mc-lab-meetings.html">MC Guide</a> for
instructions on being the MC.</p>
<p>At lab meetings we do a quick round of AIOs. &quot;AIO&quot; stands for Accomplishments,
Issues, and Objectives. Be prepared to give a brief updated on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,</li>
<li>what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally</li>
<li>what your objectives are for the coming week.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Open Science</a></h2>
<p>The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public ask you supervisor, otherwise please default to sharing early and often.
We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject
data, student protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the
involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that
should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.</p>

<p>Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">Shared Cloud Space</a></h3>
<p>We have a directory named &quot;Fietslab Commons&quot; on Google Drive. To access this,
request that it be shared with you by your supervisor. This folder and it's
contents should only be shared with other <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;netid&gt;&#64;g-tudelft.nl</span></tt> addresses
that are members of the lab. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;netid&gt;&#64;g-tudelft.nl</span></tt> is also the login
username/email that you will need to use when logging into
<a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com">https://drive.google.com</a>. Avoid using the &quot;Share&quot; button to share with
non-TUD accounts, until we determine best practices for this. Read and update
the README files present in the Google Drive directories to learn how to use
the space. If you create new directories, add a README file to explain what the
purpose of the folder is. If you want to add large amounts of data (&gt;10 Gb),
inform your supervisor first because there may be a more appropriate long term
storage solution for certain types of data.</p>

<div class="section" id="reference-management">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">Reference Management</a></h3>
<p>The lab has a shared <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 2 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference management
system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and request
membership to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum">mechmotum group</a>. Note that all lab members can view the
contents of this library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-14">Version Control</a></h3>
<p>The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/mechmotum">https://gitlab.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mechmotum">https://github.com/mechmotum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab">https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.</p>
<p>Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Git lesson</a> is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.</p>
<p><strong>Private repositories</strong> are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.</p>

<div class="section" id="tidiness">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-17">Tidiness</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The lab should be kept clean and tidy.</li>
<li>Place small trash into the two bins and paper into the blue box for pickup by
the janitors.</li>
<li>Place large trash, paper, cardboard outside in the bins near the bike cage.
Do not leave this lying in the floor of the bike lab. It will not be picked
up.</li>
<li>Always leave the lab cleaner and tidier than you found it. If followed, this
will tend towards a clean and tidy lab instead of the opposite.</li>
<li>Always clean up before the end of a work day (reserve last 15 minutes to do
so).</li>
<li>Put items and tools back in their labeled locations. If there isn't a label
or location, make one.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safety">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-18">Safety</a></h3>
<p>Our goal is to have ZERO injuries in the lab. Safety should be taken seriously
and always prioritized. Some key things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wear safety glasses and other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
when using tools. These are available in the lab or can be borrowed from the
workshop. Contact your supervisor if we need more PPE.</li>
<li>Do not use tools that you are not familiar with. Always ask someone to show
you proper use.</li>
<li>Any activities that have potential to cause injury performed outside of the
8:00-17:00 weekday (non-holiday) times should always have two people present.
During the workday period it is recommended to have a buddy present when
doing anything can cause injury, but the number of people in the halls and
glass walls make this optional.</li>
<li>The large treadmill <strong>always</strong> has to have two people for operation. When the
treadmill is operating the walker/rider must be wearing the harness properly
and the operator must have their hand on the kill switch. Ensure that objects
cannot fly off the back of the treadmill.</li>
<li>Human subject experiments must have an HREC plan and protocol (always for
PhD, Postdoc and at minimum approval from your supervisors for MSc).</li>
<li>If you are ever asking yourself &quot;should I do this?&quot;, that's probably a good
signal that you shouldn't. Get help, advice, training, etc. so that you do
your activity safely.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment-consumables">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-19">Equipment &amp; Consumables</a></h3>
<p>If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!</p>
<p>If a TU Delft staff or student that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab for TU Delft research, find out if anyone is using it
(as noted above), and then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the
lab door) with their name, email, date, and your name (as the responsible
person) before the item leaves the lab. When they return the item, indicate the
return date on the sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member students and staff
should look to the more general shared equipment resources available in ME
before borrowing from us. Do not loan common things like screwdrivers and
general tools, as those can be borrowed from the faculty machine shops. In
general, do not loan our bike tools out, researchers that need them can come to
the bike lab and use them. Do not loan tools or equipment for people's personal
use.</p>
<p>If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for <strong>more than one day</strong> you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.</p>
<p>If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution. Your caution and carefulness should be proportionate to
the cost of the lab equipment. Treat things as if they were your own and you
paid for it.</p>
<p>If you deplete some consumables, take the responsibility to replenish it so it
is there for future use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="purchasing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-20">Purchasing</a></h3>
<p>If the lab needs basic office supplies or computer supplies, a request should
be made to the secretary. Don't purchase these yourself, because they should be
purchased through the university vendors.</p>
<p>If you need some lab supplies or equipment for your project, talk with your
supervisor about it and they can order what you need if there are funds
available.</p>

<div class="section" id="equipment-inventory">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-21">Equipment Inventory</a></h3>
<p>When new equipment arrives in the lab, the receiver is responsible for
inventorying the equipment. This only needs to be done for items that cost more
than 250 EUR. The basic steps are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Log the equipment in the inventory spreadsheet on the shared Google Drive.
This should include product name, manufacturer, serial number, manufacturer
contact info, value, etc. (fill out the existing columns or make new ones if
needed).</li>
<li>Make a folder in the Google Drive for the product and deposit any
documentation.</li>
<li>If the item doesn't have a storage container, obtain one so that it can
neatly be stored in the lab and things don't get lost. Leave paper
documentation in the container.</li>
<li>Permanently mark the item(s) and container with &quot;TU Delft Bicycle Lab&quot; (use a
paint pen, inscribing tool, etc.)</li>
<li>As you learn the device, leave any relevant documentation you obtain or
create in the Google Drive folder so that future users can learn from your
work. Include the manufacturer's documents as well as your personal tips and
explanations on using the equipment. If any documentation is more appropriate
for storing and tracking with version control, then add that to a lab owned
Git repository.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="waste">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-22">Waste</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Put paper waste in the blue plastic bin by the door.</li>
<li>Put small trash in the small trash cans in the lab.</li>
<li>Metals can be recycled by putting them in the bins in the student workshop or
the bins in the basement.</li>
<li>Take larger trash and paper outside to the large bins in the rear of the ME
building.</li>
