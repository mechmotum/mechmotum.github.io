Julie van Vlerken successfully defended "`The influence of posture and stature
on bicycle handling qualities
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:3c71bc50-c6d0-4963-a3d2-5a1548f92786>`_".
Julie added rider forward lean and arm inertial effects to the Carvallo-Whipple
bicycle model, the later of which is known to remove a bicycle's
self-stabilization property. She then calculated a task independent handling
quality metric based on a human steering control model and assessed different
sized Gazelle bicycles with different rider size and posture for positive and
negative effects to lateral handling. She discovered that it is more difficult
for smaller riders to steer than larger riders and that postures that lean
forward also make it more difficult to steer. Her model and findings can be
used in the design phase to improve handling of new bicycle designs. Julie also
gave our bicycle dynamics web application a make over with new aesthetics and
new features:

Julie was co-supervised by Leila Alizadehsaravi (TU Delft), Jason K. Moore (TU
Delft), and Arend Schwab (TU Delft). Engineers Jan Siksma, Hans Vreman, and
Sierd Heida at Gazelle also provided support and assistance with the project.
Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Julie and wishes her the best her
path forward.
