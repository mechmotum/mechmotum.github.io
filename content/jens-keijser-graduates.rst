Jens Keijser successfully defended "`Investigating the Theoretical Feasibility
of Longitudinal Motion Control in Indoor Cycling Trainers
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:d48c5066-0c44-40a7-9f7e-4bebd3756dcd>`_". He
developed a simulation of an indoor cycling trainer that itself simulated
longitudinal motion with only cadence and crank torque as inputs. He verified
that the simulator had similar motion behavior as the cyclist would experience
riding on a treadmill by comparing to motion capture data.

Jens was co-supervised by Jelle Hassnoot (Tacx/Garmin) and Jason K. Moore (TU
Delft). Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Jens and wishes him the
best in his next adventures.
