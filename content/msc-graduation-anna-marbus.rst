Anna Marbus successfully defended "`Cyclist Conflict Behaviour in Shared Spaces
<https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:092f3b70-2d97-436e-b193-139a593e09c7>`_" on
April 17th, 2025. Anna developed an experiment with pairs of cyclists that
forced them to interact with each other in an uncontrolled shared space when
crossing paths.  She measured the trajectories of the cyclist with an accurate
GNSS measurement system and arranged four different interaction starting
configurations. She then investigated how the cyclists adjusted their path,
changed their speed, and whether they yielded. She found that cyclists tend to
use path adjustments over speed adjustments. For yielding behavior she found
that those who entered the shared space later and with lower speeds were most
likely to yield and that cyclists who approached from the left were also mostly
likely to yield. Unlike prior studies, she did not find that gender influenced
yielding behavior. Anna's data and findings will help us, and others, develop
more realistic interaction models for microsimulation safety assessment.

The following videos show the trajectories of example cyclists for all the
configuration angles:

Anna was co-supervised by Christoph Konrad, Riender Happee, and Jason K.
Moore. Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Anna and wishes her the
best in her next adventures.
