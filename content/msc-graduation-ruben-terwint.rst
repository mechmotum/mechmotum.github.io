Ruben Terwint successfully defended his MSc thesis titled, `Linking Traffic
Condition Metrics to a Cyclist's Workload
<https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:4642837e-d0a9-44ed-871d-17bc4e903ddf>`_
on September 15, 2025.

Ruben extracted metrics from video captured from glasses worn by a cyclist
while they rode through the city of Delft and corresponding verbal workload
levels reported by the cyclist. He then developed a regression model based on
the traffic metrics to predict the subjective workload reported by the rider.
He found that ego cyclist speed was a main predictor of workload and concluded
that cyclists modulate their speed when in high workload areas. This result is
consistent with self regulation to reduce the task difficulty in prior general
driver behavior findings.

Ruben was supervised by Jules Ronné, Holger Caesar, and Jason K. Moore.
Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Ruben and wishes him the best in
his next adventures in studying machine learning in the UK.
