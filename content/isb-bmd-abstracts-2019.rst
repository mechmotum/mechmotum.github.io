:summary: Blog post to share recent conference abstract submissions.

The lab has just submitted a series of abstracts for three upcoming conferences
in 2019.

We submitted an abstract on the `soon to be submitted rowing biomechanics paper
<https://engrxiv.org/nykuh>`_ to the `International Society of Biomechanics &
American Society of Biomechanics meeting <https://isb2019.com>`_ in Calgary in
late July.

- "Adaptive smartphone-based sensor fusion for estimating competitive rowing
  kinematic metrics" is on work done by undergraduates Bryn Cloud, Britt
  Tarien, Ada Liu, and Thomas Shedd during 2018. `[PDF]
  <https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/isb2019-abstract.pdf>`__

We also submitted three abstracts to the `Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics
conference in Padova, Italy <https://bmd2019.org/>`_ in September.

- "Practical Realization of a Theoretical Optimal-Handling Bicycle" is on work
  done by undergraduate Roy Gilboa this past summer.  `[PDF]
  <https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bmd2019-abstract-gilboa.pdf>`__
- "Design of an Electric Bicycle Speed Controller" is on work done by
  undergraduate Trevor Metz since this past June.  `[PDF]
  <https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bmd2019-abstract-metz.pdf>`__
- "Expanded Optimization for Discovering Optimal Lateral Handling Bicycle" is
  on work Mont, Ron, and I are continuing on optimal handling bicycles.  `[PDF]
  <https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/bmd2019-abstract-moore.pdf>`__

And finally, we submitted an abstract on our work about ski jump design to the
`International Society of Skiing Safety meeting <https://www.isss2019.com/>`_
at Squaw Valley in April.

- "Accessible, Open-source Computational Analysis and Design of Terrain Park
  Ski Jumps" based on work done by Bryn Cloud, Britt Tarien, Mont Hubbard and
  me. `[PDF] <https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/isss2019-abstract.pdf>`__

We are crossing our fingers for acceptance! Thanks for all the hard work from
the students!
