Description
===========

TU Delft is seeking a postdoctoral researcher for a 1 year equivalent contract
(full or part time). The researcher will develop and execute an engineering
research project with the title "Modeling bicycle behavior from visual stimulus
to neuromuscular control ability". This project is funded by a TU Delft
internal Cohesion grant and is a collaboration between the Intelligent Vehicles
section and the Bicycle Laboratorium, both part of the Mechanical Engineering
faculty. The purpose of the project is to use Computer Vision and bicycle
dynamics models to accurately model cyclist behavior to improve bicycle and
road designs, as well as safety in sustainable transportation.

Accurate motion data on cyclists is scarce. Existing data has been largely
collected via counting at specific locations or GPS. However, the accuracy of
GPS is limited and there is no data that can track bicyclists with centimeter
accuracy in urban environments. We recently developed a bicycle equipped with
the latest automotive-grade sensors. By using visual odometry from IMUs, lidar
and cameras, we are able to drastically improve the localization performance
over GPS. We are further developing a perception system to detect other traffic
participants from the bicycle.

In the next stage you will equip cyclists with eye tracking devices to capture
their gaze direction during rides in crowded urban environments (e.g. the Delft
campus). The collected data will serve as input to a motion planner and mapped
to neuromuscular balance ability, i.e. reaction time and sensing quality,
needed to safely control the bicycle. By modeling how gaze influences decision
making and how vision interacts with vestibular and proprioceptive sensing to
maintain balance in safety critical maneuvers, you will gain crucial insights
into how individuals perceive risks such as stop signs and crossing
pedestrians, and the corresponding actions they undertake, such as braking and
counter-steering.

Requirements
============

You should have:

- PhD in an engineering discipline by the start date of the position -
  Experience with machine learning for computer vision
- Strong scientific programming skills
- Strong written and oral communication skills in English
- The ability to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with
  members of a larger team

The following aspects will help you stand out:

- A strong academic track record with publications in topics relevant to this
  position
- Knowledge of automated driving from perception to planning
- Specific knowledge of deep learning and data efficient methods
- Knowledge of human-machine control and two-wheeler vehicle dynamics
- Knowledge of Python and PyTorch

Keep in mind that this describes the background we imagine would best fit the
role. Even if you do not meet all of the requirements and feel that you are up
for the task, we absolutely want to see your application! 

Additional Information
======================

In this role you will be embedded with the Intelligent Vehicles section in the
Cognitive Robotics Department and also a member of the Bicycle Lab in the
Biomechanical Engineering Department. Assistant Professors Holger Caesar and
Jason K. Moore will be your supervisors. For more information about this
vacancy, please contact Holger Caesar (h.caesar@tudelft.nl).
