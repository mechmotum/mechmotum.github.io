  abstract = {A lot of research has been done on the behaviour of pneumatic tyres and this has led to various tyre models and a lot of measurement data. However, in the specific field of bicycle tyres, not so much measurement data is available. However, in 2013 Andrew Dressel received the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee by presenting his research: Measuring and modeling the mechanical properties of bicycle tires. In this research he did a lot of measurements with multiple bicycle tyre brands and models under different conditions. The results from these measurements are interesting to use for modelling purposes. The goal of this research is to find out if it is possible to estimate the bicycle tyre behaviour in terms of vertical stiffness, cornering stiffness and camber stiffness based on known parameters like the inflation pressure, tyre width, rim width, vertical load and the rubber compound using a tyre model. An important part of this thesis are tyre models. The measurement data will be analysed using various tyre models. The first used tyre model is the brush model. This model uses a single material parameter and it turns out that this is too less to be able to extract clear relations between the tyre behaviour and the known parameters like inflation pressure, tyre width and rim width. The second tyre model that is used is the enhanced string model. This model is an extension of the brush model. This model has three material parameters for the vertical direction and also three material parameters for the lateral direction. Investigating this model shows that there is reasonable suspicion to assume that one of the model parameters represents the inflation pressure. In order to find the material parameters for every tyre, inflation pressure and normal load combination a parameter optimisation is required. The results from this parameter optimisation show that the suspected model parameter is actually not related to the inflation pressure. When the obtained model parameters from the optimisation are put back into the tyre model interesting results are acquired, because the model output agrees fairly well with the measurement data. This is unexpected because the model parameters were differing a lot depending on how they were obtained, e.g. obtaining the parameters from cornering stiffness or from camber stiffness. The answer to the research question is no. In order to extract relations between the model parameters and the tyres behaviour depending on their measurable properties, a lot more complete measurements are needed. The whole idea was to be able to estimate tyre behaviour without the need of extensive testing. This still might be possible, but in order to to that a lot more measurements are needed first. These measurements should create a baseline of model parameters which can be used to estimate the model parameters of unmeasured tyres.},

  title = {Rider Control Identification in Cycling Taking into Account Steer Torque Feedback and Sensorial Delays},
  author = {Christoforidis, Christos},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Experimental data were obtained from riding a steer-by-wire bicycle on the open road while perturbing balance with impulsive forces at the seat post (lateral pertubations) as well as perturbing balance with impulsive torques at the steering assembly (steering pertubations). The experiments were conducted at 2.6\textendash 5.6 m/s covering both the stable and the unstable forward speed range. For the lateral pertubation experiments two conditions were explored; normal steering and reduced torque feedback steering. Three metrics are used to assess the effect of torque feedback on rider steer control and balance. Results failed to indicate any statistically significant difference between experimental conditions. Bicycle and rider mechanics have been modeled using the Whipple bicycle model extended with the rider inertia. A rider control model is developed that incorporates all of human's sensory pathways and includes a strategy to compensate for sensory dead time. The identified rider control parameters, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior. From the results the importance of the torque feedback pathway is strongly indicated. Finally for the steering pertubations the rider control model is modified to account for the cocontraction mechanism. The model manages to approximate the rider measured response and simultaneously captures the significance of the intrinsic response. A high level of intersubject variability is exhibited. The hypothesis that this variability is in fact due to the modulation of admittance in the shoulder joint is strongly suggested.\&lt;br/\&gt;},

The ubiquity of smartphones with embedded position (GPS) and motion (accelerometer) sensors motivates their possible use in these tasks. In this paper, we investigate the use of two real-time digital filters to achieve highly accurate yet reasonably priced measurements of boat speed and distance traveled. Both filters combine acceleration and location data to estimate boat distance and speed; the first using a complementary frequency response-based filter technique, the second with a Kalman filter formalism that includes adaptive, real-time estimates of effective accelerometer bias. The estimates of distance and speed from both filters were validated and compared with accurate reference data from a differential GPS system with better than 1 cm precision and a 5 Hz update rate, in experiments using two subjects (an experienced club-level rower and an elite rower) in two different boats on a 300 m course. Compared with single channel (smartphone GPS only) measures of distance and speed, the complementary filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 44\%, 42\%, and 73\%, respectively, while the Kalman filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 48\%, 22\%, and 82\%, respectively. Both filters demonstrate promise as general purpose methods to substantially improve estimates of important rowing performance metrics.},

The purpose of our steer-by-wire bicycle is to investigate the influence of handlebar torque feedback on rider control in order to understand rider control on a bicycle. In addition, steerby-wire bicycles have the potential to be used as stability-enhancing support systems which can improve cycling safety. We demonstrate the design and performance of the steer-by-wire bicycle in computer simulations as well as real-life tests. Preliminary rider tests showed a perceived near-to-identical behaviour of the steer-by-wire system to a mechanical connection at steering frequencies below 3 Hz.},

Unfortunately, these studies are dangerous for the rider, given that the bicycle is a laterally unstable vehicle and most of the time in need for rider balance control. Moreover, the bicycle rider is very vulnerable and not easily protected against impact injuries. A bicycle simulator, on which the rider can balance and manoeuvre a bicycle within a simulated environment and interact with other simulated road users, would solve most of these issues.

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to derive bicycle rider control models, based on experimental data, that mimic the rider in his balance control task at various forward speeds. These rider control models can help to understand cyclists falls, improve training techniques, assess the handling properties of new bicycle designs and create active balance control systems (e.g. steer assist). This thesis consists of 9 chapters; Chapter 1 introduces relevant background theory and identifies the research gap.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Chapter 2 presents some effects of crosswind on the lateral dynamics of a bicycle and on rider control. The chapter gives an insight on how rider control modelling can be used to assess crosswind related falls. Simulations indicated that crosswind has a considerable effect on the stability and control of the bicycle. Increasing wind speed can make an uncontrolled bicycle resonate for all forward speeds. The rider control effort increases considerably and a constant steer torque is required to keep the bicycle at a straight heading.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Chapter 3 investigates the dynamic response of the bicycle rider's body during vertical, fore-and-aft and lateral perturbations in order to understand how riders are using postural control to restrain excessive movements and prevent falling off the seat. The analysis is presented by means of apparent mass (APMS) and seat-to-sternum transmissibility (STST) functions in the frequency domain. Measured forces at saddle, steer and pedals revealed that for each individual motion the rider applied forces in all three directions. Heave and surge motion interacted with each other and had similar responses. Sway showed totally different responses and weak interaction with the other two motions. Resonant frequencies were considerably higher in the vertical direction as compared to the longitudinal direction. Lateral measurements showed no resonance, and trunk postural control was evident in the APMS. The results of this chapter can be used to identify the parameters of biodynamic lumped human-machine models. Such models can support the development of more comfortable and safe bicycle designs and suspension systems.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Chapter 4 presents the design and implementation of an instrumented steer-by-wire bicycle (SBW) that was designed and built at TU Delft bicycle laboratory. The\&lt;br/\&gt;SBW was used as a versatile experimental platform to capture the rider's responses with (haptics on) and without steering torque feedback (haptics off) during lateral perturbation experiments. Simulations and testing of the steer-by-wire system indicated good tracking performance between 0-2.5 Hz and almost identical steer stiffness with the Carvallo Whipple bicycle model in a frequency range of 0-3 Hz and in a forward speed range of 0-10 m/s. The bicycle served its purpose successfully, the responses of the rider's control actions with lateral perturbations were captured by means of impulse response functions (IRFs) in chapter 5. Results failed to indicate any statistically significant difference between the two steering configurations (haptics on/ off).\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Chapter 6 presents and validates a parametric rider control model using data presented in Chapter 5 and uses this model to further assess the effect of haptic\&lt;br/\&gt;feedback in the balance task of bicycling. Bicycle and rider mechanics have been modelled using the Carvallo Whipple bicycle model extended with rider inertia. A\&lt;br/\&gt;balancing and heading controller was added, capturing visual, vestibular and proprioceptive sensory information using feedback of roll angle, roll angle rate, heading angle, heading angle rate, steering angle and steering torque, taking into account muscular activation dynamics. Non-parametric and parametric model responses failed to indicate any statistically significant difference between the haptics on/off configurations. However, further analysing the haptic off configuration it became apparent that the rider still receives relevant torque feedback due to the inertia of the handlebars. The reduced feedback was proven to be adequate for the rider to control the bicycle without any major steering discrepancies. To further evaluate the effect of torque feedback in simulations we disconnected the handlebar torque feedback loop of the parametric rider model. In addition, we also disconnected the handlebar position and velocity feedback. Results showed that handlebar torque feedback is significantly important during the riding process. This knowledge might be crucial for the development of new safety systems that could further optimize bicycle handling and assist the rider's steer control actions in critical situations preventing falls.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Chapter 7 outlines the design and hardware selection for a bicycle simulator. The design requirements together with a detailed description of the hardware selection and testing are presented. The simulator was designed to explore human control behaviour in a safe environment. Preliminary tests showed that all subjects can balance and manoeuvre the bicycle when a simplified bicycle model is used to generate haptic feedback and project the dynamics in the virtual environment. Visual roll of the horizon turned out to be an effective tool for creating the illusion of physical roll but motion sickness was reported.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;This thesis ends with the discussion and conclusion Chapters 8, 9 highlighting the developed experimental facilities and the main findings of the research. The chapters herein investigate the effects of external perturbations on bicycle stability and human control using numerical modelling and experimental bicycles capable of measuring kinematics and rider applied forces. This interdisciplinary approach delves into the foundations of human control modelling from both a biomechanical and biomechatronics engineering perspective in an effort to improve cycling safety and reduce falls.},

  abstract = {On all levels of rowing, a general rule is that you have to row together. Rowing together has no clear-cut definition. However, it is known that each rower has his or her own style, which can be registered in movement patterns and force curves. The big question is how to combine these individual styles such that the crew works together in the best way. The Dutch Rowing Federation showed interest in this topic, wanting to know how to adjust the rigging dimensions of the boat to allow the best racing performance. The goal of this thesis is to provide advice on what features of the rowing stroke should be synchronized and whether and how this could be promoted by individualized rigging.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The theoretical foundation for this study was a literature study about the current knowledge on the rowing stroke and differences within and between individuals and crews. Current used measures on performance and synchronization of rowers were described, and finally a proposal was done for which methods to use in the ongoing of the study.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Data was obtained from five female athletes of elite level, doing trials in a quadruple sculls of approximately 30 seconds at 30 SPM and 32 SPM in four different combinations. The strokes were identified and analyzed, based on performance and synchronization measures. Performance measured as Average Speed, Work per Stroke, Blade Losses, Velocity Fluctuation Losses and their respective and combined efficiencies. Synchronization measures were defined as Mean Standard Deviation of the Phase, Standard Deviation of the Time to Half Impulse and Standard Deviation of the Time to Half Work.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The chosen synchronization measures were not completely independent. Standard deviations of time to half impulse and half work were found to be highly similar (r = 0.970). An opposite effect was found between kinematic synchronization and the other two, Mean Standard deviation of the Phase was not in line with the empirical rule that better synchronization leads to better performance. The kinetic and energetic measures did show this effect: Lower standard deviations of time to half impulse and time to half work meant higher average speed (r = -0.193) and higher Work per Stroke (r = -0.574).\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The best performing synchronization measure was time to half impulse synchrony. A drawback on this measure was that the sampling period was long, compared to the interpolated time differences. Athletes were found to achieve their half impulse moments in a consistent order.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;To find out whether it is possible to promote synchronization and thus performance by individualizing rigging, the oar angles at the time to half impulse were analyzed. This new measure correlated moderately (r = 0.624), meaning it quantifies more or less the same effect. The kinetic similarity actually worked better (r = -0.292 with Average Speed and r = -0.748 with Work per Stroke) than the synchronization measure.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Similarity of half impulse angles enables the coach to adjust the rigging such that the timing should improve too. However, this should be tested in a follow-up study.},

A custom made bicycle mock-up equipped with a system of sensors has been developed, capable of measuring the linear accelerations, angular velocity and the rider's force responses in all translational axes of all bicycle interfaces. The bicycle mock-up is driven by a hexapod that generates coloured noise perturbations in the range 0\textendash 10 Hz. Twenty four healthy male adults participated in this study and gave informed consent according to the guidelines of the ethical committee of Delft University of Technology. The responses of all subjects are represented in the frequency domain by means of frequency response functions. More specific, the interaction of the rider's body at the seat, foot pegs and handlebars are expressed in terms of apparent mass and as seat-to-sternum transmissibility functions (STS). The apparent mass and STS transfer functions for the surge and heave motion suggest a simple underlying passive response system. For surge, a clear resonance peak was found at 2 Hz for nearly all interfaces and directions, whereas, for the heave motion a clear resonance peak at 5 Hz was found for the seat and handlebars and a resonance peak at 6 Hz for the foot pegs. The apparent mass of the pitch and yaw motion also suggest, to a certain extend, simple passive dynamics after 1 Hz characterised by resonance peaks at 1.8 and 2.3 Hz, respectively. Only the corresponding yaw STS transfer function showed a resonance peak around 2.3 Hz, as well. The sway and roll motion do not suggest simple passive dynamics showing similar trends in apparent mass characterised by an ever-decreasing gain and no resonance peaks. Finally, the surge, heave, pitch and yaw apparent mass transfer functions suggest that higher body mass in general yields higher peak magnitude and lower resonance frequency. This effect was most apparent for the surge motion.},

  abstract = {A riderless bicycle can automatically steer itself so as to recover from falls. The common view is that this self-steering is caused by gyroscopic precession of the front wheel, or by the wheel contact trailing like a caster behind the steer axis. We show that neither effect is necessary for self-stability. Using linearized stability calculations as a guide, we built a bicycle with extra counter-rotating wheels (canceling the wheel spin angular momentum) and with its front-wheel ground-contact forward of the steer axis (making the trailing distance negative). When laterally disturbed from rolling straight, this bicycle automatically recovers to upright travel. Our results show that various design variables, like the front mass location and the steer axis tilt, contribute to stability in complex interacting ways. A new bicycle design points to the importance of mass distribution for stability. A new bicycle design points to the importance of mass distribution for stability.},

  abstract = {Part of the goal of Europe's Strategy Vision Zero is to eliminate all severe cycling accidents in Europe by 2030. The majority of cycling accidents are single vehicle accidents; this term indicates the absence of collisions with other road participants and implies a fall of the cyclist. Research has shown that mainly elderly cyclists are victim to those accidents. An untested hypothesis is that their slowed motor responses are one of the main reasons behind this. This study aims to address this hypothesis by studying the influence of neural time delay on the lateral stability of bicycle-rider systems. In this study, the slowed motor responses are represented by single neural time delay values. The influence is quantified by the sizes of the identified basins of attraction of stability (BoA). The BoA contains the set of finite lateral disturbances for which stability is\&lt;br/\&gt;retained and is acquired via numerical integration. Binary threshold criteria are used to determine the stability of the solution. The bicycle-rider system consists of two components: a bicycle model and a rider model. The bicycle is modelled using the Whipple(-Carvallo) bicycle model with the set of non-linear equations derived by Basu-Mandal [2]. The rider is modelled using an implicit experimentally validated model from literature [31]. This model consists of a PID controller with full state feedback, neuro-muscular dynamics and, in this study, is extended to include nonzero time delay. The neural time delay value of a young cyclist has been based on literature [4]. The value is doubled to model an older cyclist. The control strategy of the young cyclist is identified using system identification techniques. The basins of the young and old cyclist are compared to study the detrimental effect of time delay on lateral stability in cycling. It declined over 80\% when the time delay was doubled. The human's ability to adapt its control to circumstances has been considered by repeating the control identification process for the rider which suffers from double the time delay. With respect to the young cyclist, a decline of over 50\% was observed. Therefore, the results strongly support the hypothesis. Further research should focus on increasing complexity of the rider model to include preview and prediction. In this way, the influence of slowed motor responses can be mapped more clearly.\&lt;br/\&gt; A secondary objective of this thesis is the preliminary development of a steer assist control model to aid the elderly cyclist balance during cycling. This development builds further on a simple control model from literature [29] which uses roll angle feedback. As a result, a nonlinear velocity dependent roll rate feedback control law was developed. This control law yields a constant basin height over the commonly used velocity range of cyclists. This height indicates the maximum allowable steer rate perturbations the bicycle-steer assist system could handle and is approximately the same height as what was identified for\&lt;br/\&gt;a young cyclist. Future research is required for improving the steer assist. This means adding maximum allowable control torque, sensorial time delays and trajectory tracking},

The framework draws on existing literature in cognitive science about driver behaviour to explain experimental results from cycling field trials, and the modelling of these results. We modelled braking and steering manoeuvres from field data of cyclists' obstacle avoidance within their comfort zone. Results show that when cyclists avoided obstacles by braking, they kept a constant deceleration; as speed increased, they started to brake earlier, farther from the obstacle, maintaining an almost constant time to collision. When cyclists avoided obstacles by steering, they maintained a constant distance from the object, independent of speed. Overall, the higher the speed, the more the steering manoeuvres were temporally delayed compared to braking manoeuvres. We discuss these results and other similarities between cyclist and driver behaviour during obstacle avoidance. Implications for the design of acceptable active safety and infrastructure design are also addressed.},

  abstract = {This thesis reports on the development a low cost and mass-producible bicycle powered irrigation pump for small-scale (100\textendash 1,000 m2 plot) African farmers. The pump is intended to be made and distributed by World Bicycle Relief's Buffalo Bikes program. This project's process is divided into three parts: an investigation into the user needs, quantitative testing of a prototype pump's power and efficiency, and the redesign of the pump for manufacturing.   In order to clarify the user needs, I conducted in-depth interviews and informal demonstrations with small-scale farmers in Kenya. I learned of additional user requirements; for example, that the pump must be usable by children. I also learned of critical problems with the early design; for example, that air leaks on the suction side of the pump will hobble its performance. Though imperfect, the limited success of the trials verified the viability of a bicycle irrigation pump in the target market.  To quantify the effectiveness of a centrifugal bicycle powered pump, I measured the pump's water flow at various input power levels and outlet heights (vertical heads). The efficiency of the pump system ({$\eta$} {$\approx$} 55\%) approached the claimed manufacturer's maximum efficiency of {$\eta$} {$\approx$} 66\%. I then compared the bicycle pump to two other human powered pumps, both of which use a treadle pumping style. The bicycle system pumps water at similar or possibly higher flows than the tested treadle pumps. Friction calculations additionally revealed that at fast flow rates of 1 liter per second (16 gallons per minute), hoses with a 1 inch diameter (25.4 mm) have significant friction losses, while 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) hoses have negligible friction losses.  Based on the interviews and efficiency tests, I redesigned the pump and gearbox to be made of plastic and to address the main issues identified in the field. The pump-to-hose attachments are designed to reduce air leaks, reduce tipping, and simplify the pump's setup. The form of the gearbox is designed without overhangs so that it can be manufactured by casting. By creating an inexpensive irrigation method, I hope to empower small-scale African farmers to lift themselves into prosperity.},

These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling.

Here we expand that method to optimize over all of the geometric and inertial parameters in the linear Whipple-Carvallo bicycle model. To ensure physically realizable bicycle designs we include 7 equality constraints, 21 inequality constraints, and lower and upper bounds on each free optimization parameter. This improves over the prior work by expanding the search space with many more parameters and the guarantee of physical realizability. We present four bicycle designs discovered by the optimization procedure that have optimal later handling qualities. The bicycles are similar in design to familiar bicycle designs but are not generally self-stable and exhibit unusual characteristics such as large positive and negative trail, large size relative to the rider, and minimal steering inertia. The method is a useful tool for generating atypical bicycle designs that exhibit desired dynamical qualities and could be broadly applied to other vehicle designs.},

Models that provide predictions of race performance already exist for individual time trials. It is proposed that with a performance model for team time trials, the performance of different strategies can be compared and optimised.\&lt;br/\&gt;In literature combinations of mechanical resistance models and physiological models are used to determine the performance of individual time trials. The aerodynamic interaction between cyclists is very important to the effectiveness of a strategy. Coefficients of drag reduction between cyclists in a team time trial are presented in several studies, however most studies use groups of only four cyclists, which is not useful for a team time trial with eight cyclists. Only two studies report data for groups up to eight cyclists. These two models show different behaviour and are both used to asses the performance of strategies. Also two physiological models were used.\&lt;br/\&gt;In the model provided in this study the resistances are calculated from the kinematics resulting from the evaluated strategy. The mechanical resistance model, including the aerodynamic interaction model calculates the power required to perform the strategy. The physiological model calculates the physiology during the race, which determines if the cyclists are able to sustain the prescribed strategy.\&lt;br/\&gt;Genetic algorithm optimisation is used to optimise the strategy parameters, such as initial position and times spend in first position. The velocity is optimised for each evaluated strategy configuration. A convergence test was performed to determine the parameters for the genetic algorithm, which are used in the optimisation of strategy.\&lt;br/\&gt;Using the standard strategy, where cyclists only change from first to last position, different orders are compared. From this study it was determined that the mean velocity over a 30 km team time trial could be raised by a maximum of 0.228 m/s by improving the order, depending on the model configuration. It was found that the best performing orders were those where the mean performance difference of following cyclists was lowest.\&lt;br/\&gt;Two different strategies have been assessed where cyclists still always change from first, but not necessarily last position have been assessed on their performance. With those more complex strategies the mean velocity could be increased with 0.358 m/s over a 30 km team time trial. \&lt;br/\&gt;The model still lacks validity, but gives a relevant insight in the performance of different team time trial strategies. The validity can either improved by using track test to validate the drag reduction coefficients or by using power data from a team time trial to show that the model predicts realistic physiology. Of those two methods the last is preferred.},

  abstract = {Bicycle paths or even bicycle lanes have not emerged as key priorities in traditional pavement systems analysis. Most cities rely on route preferences (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;common school routes) or visual checks to prioritize pavement conditions on bicycle facilities. We used 31 bike path sections with a representative range of pavement surface conditions to collect acceleration data, GPS location data, bicycle steering angle, surface displacement data, and mean texture depth (MTD) data. We also recruited cyclists to complete a post-ride survey on ride quality. Using these data, we specified two ordered logit regression models to separately examine the relationships between bicycle ride quality and traditional pavement roughness measurement (or surface defect density on trajectories) while holding other parameters (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;bicycle accelerations and steering angle) constant. Our study shows that a surface defect index can replace the MTD test for bicycle facilities and can produce better performance in predicting ride quality, especially when pavement condition needs moderate repair to avoid becoming much worse. We also examine ride quality, specifically the vertical acceleration effect on ride experience, for different types of bicycles (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;a mountain bike with a suspension system versus a touring bike).},

Currently, there is not enough information about instrumentation in skeleton, and to maintain competitive advantages, most of the research remains private and unpublished. Athletes use their shoulders and knees to steer down the track. For this reason, four handmade piezoresistive tactile force sensors were built to measure the force applied by each joint. Each sensor has its own model to convert bits recorded into force. Results showed a difference between applied and calculated forces by each model. However, calculated results followed similar trends compared to the real values of the applied force. In addition, a graphical user interface was created to present the results to the athlete in a simple and easy way to read and understand. It is planned to use a shimmer (an inertial measurement unit) to collect information about accelerations developed on each run. Coupling both measurement systems have to be done during the processing stage. Further work has to be done regarding electronics size and testing the systems in a real run down the track.},

A roll angle estimation is also useful in other situations, such as tests to perform the identification of the parameters of the rider control. In this work, a new algorithm is presented for estimating the roll angle of bicycles. This estimator, based on the well-known Kalman filter, employs a wheel speed sensor to approximate the speed of the vehicle, and three angular rate sensors, which are currently small and affordable sensors. The proposed method was implemented in a microcontroller and tested in a bicycle and the results were compared with measurements obtained with optical sensors, showing a good correlation. Although it has not been tested in motorcycles, comparable results are expected.},

  abstract = {The bicycle is an intriguing machine as it is laterally unstable at low speed and stable, or easy to stabilize, at high speed. During the last decade a revival in the research on dynamics and control of bicycles has taken place [1]. Most studies use the so-called Whipple [2] model of a bicycle. In this model a rigid rider is rigidly connected to the rear frame. However, from experience it is known that some form of control is required to stabilize the bicycle and/or carry out tracking operations. This control is either carried out by steering or by performing some sort of upper body motions. Note that in both cases the system is underactuated. The precise control used by the rider is still under study [3]. This paper addresses the question whether the underactuated bicycle is controllable by only steering or upper body motion in the forward speed range of 0 to 36 km/h. Whipple-like models are studied with either steering or upper body control. It is shown that at certain specific forward speeds some modes are uncontrollable. However, either the forward speed is extremely low or the uncontrollable modes are all stable modes and are therefore of no concern to the rider.},

A rider control model applying steering torque at the handle bars has been developed exploring potential feedback of visual, vestibular and arm proprioceptive cues. The identified rider control parameters, after model reduction, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior. The feedback gains of this control model were used to identify the specific optimal control linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function which the rider was using to control the bicycle.

  abstract = {The goal of the Human Power Team from the TU Delft and the Free University of Amsterdam is to break the world speed record in unpaced cycling (Sam Whittingham, 133.28 km/h). The design of such a faired recumbent bicycle is a challenge. The Delft design, called VeloX (Human Power Team (2013)), is a fully-faired monocoque front-driven recumbent bicycle, with minimized air drag and maximized space for a big and strong athlete. However, front driven bicycles have the disadvantage that the front driving induces unwanted steering and that the frontal area of the bicycle cannot be reduced any further. A solution would be rear-wheel steering. A common thought is that a rear-wheel steered bicycle cannot be laterally self-stable, and therefore hard to control. However, recent research (Knoll et al. (2012)) has shown that one can design a rear-wheel steered bicycle which shows a stable forward speed range. Based on these results a rear-wheel steered recumbent bicycle has been designed, within the existing design constraints. Although not self-stable, this design shows a mildly lateral unstable behavior in the desired forward speed range of 0 to 40 m/s (0 to 144 km/h). Computer simulations demonstrate that the bicycle can be stabilized by adding a human controller model (Schwab et al. (2013)) to the bicycle model. For a set of expected lateral perturbations (side wind perturbations) it is shown that rider steer torque stays within human bounds, both in magnitude and in frequency. Future work is dedicated to building and testing a prototype of the design.},

  abstract = {The track bound sliding sport of Skeleton was permanently added to Winter Olympics programme in 2002. This has led to increased interest in the sport. Engineering has already proved to be a vital contributor to improved performance in the related sport of Bobsleighing. We hope that engineering can do the same for Skeleton. This report describes an attempt at developing a platform to be used as a real-time training simulator for the sport of Skeleton. For a multitude of reasons athletes are, on average limited to a total of two hours of practice and competitive on-track time in any given year. When compared with time spent practising and in competition in most sports, this is extremely low. It is hypothesized that a simulator can augment track time by providing a realistic environment to practise in, even when access to a track is not available. This work is guided by simulators that have been developed for Bobsleighing. The main components are the models to describe the dynamics of the sport, an input method and visualization of the simulation. The main considerations for the dynamic model are of the track surface, the sled and contact between sled and track surface. These models lead to a system of equations which when solved provide accelerations and contact forces. The accelerations are integrated over a fixed time interval to determine changes in velocities, position and orientation. The position and orientation obtained after the integration is passed on to a game engine which provides the user with real-time visual output of the position and orientation along a digitally recreated track surface. A video game controller was chosen to serve as the input device. It has two joysticks, which can be mapped so as to mimic the forces applied by an athlete. A number of descents were performed using this platform both at real-time speed and at a slower speed to give the user, unfamiliar with the sport, a better chance to steer the sled. We were able to consistently reach the exit of curve 2 in real-time speed and curve 4 at the slower play speed before failure of the simulation. In most cases the algorithm used here proves to take lesser time for computation than the chosen integration time step, which is a great sign for future development as we did not make any attempts to optimise its omputation\&lt;br/\&gt;time. We made an attempt at validation using time elapsed to traverse a certain distance and the sum of magnitude of Lagrangian multipliers. We had poor results with the time elapsed comparison, with simulated runs being 15\% slower than competitive descents. While the sum of Lagrangian multipliers showed good relation to expected behaviour. This first attempt was reasonably successful, and we believe that the lessons learnt from this work has brought us one step closer to realizing a training simulator that can be useful to Skeleton athletes.},

The optimization is performed for a simplified biomechanical model. The vaulter contains three segments: arms, a trunk including the head and legs. The joints are represented by torque actuators, located at the hands, shoulder joint and hip joint. The torque profile of each actuator is optimized. The optimization starts just after the pole is planted. It ends when the vaulter releases the pole. The pole length, pole stiffness, the vaulter's length, the vaulter's mass and the take-off angle are varied to discover the influence of these parameters on the control strategy. Three control strategies are found, as well as two power management strategies. Global trends are found. An increased pole stiffness, a decrease in length and mass of the athlete and a decreased take-off angle improved the performance. A possible optimal pole length is found.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Running-specific prostheses enable amputee athletes to perform at the highest level. However, current prosthesis design still impairs sprinting performance in multiple ways. An example is the constant mechanical stiffness of the prosthetic devices. The dynamic behaviour of the blade is determined by this property, but it is static and cannot change according to the gait phase-specific sprinting dynamics.\&lt;br/\&gt;During acceleration a different stiffness might be required as opposed to steady state running. Therefore, it is hypothesised that amputee athletes can improve their performance with prostheses that have a gait phase-specific stiffness.\&lt;br/\&gt;In order to investigate the effect of stiffness on amputee sprinting performance a novel and unprecedented modelling approached is used. Modelling is economical and straightforward in comparison to other research methods such as laboratory experiments. In this thesis, an extension of the established Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model is proposed that qualitatively describes amputee sprinting motion. The Actuated Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (ASLIP) is capable of predicting stable forwardly integrated sprinting motion with the inclusion of the start and acceleration phase. Optimisation of the model predicts that phase-specific spring stiffness leads to a significant time reduction on the 100m sprint for given physiological parameters. In general it can be said that a stiffer spring results in better performance. More specifically, the model benefits from a stiff spring during acceleration and a more compliant one in steady state. Although it has its limitations, the ASLIP model additionally provides a valuable insight into the mechanics of amputee sprinting. For example, it seems that optimal phase-specific stiffness is strongly dependent on biomechanical parameters such as touchdown angle, force angle and CoM velocity. Future work in this direction can provide a better understanding of the\&lt;br/\&gt;underlying mechanisms that determine amputee sprinting performance.\&lt;br/\&gt;The outcomes of this study suggest that amputee sprinters might be able to achieve a reduction in finishing time with prosthetic devices that have a phase-specific stiffness. The modelling approach used in this thesis is promising and lends itself well to investigate this opportunity in more detail.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {This exploration study focuses on the braking behaviour of World Tour cyclists during a descent. For this study, 8 riders descended over 6 trials using a `sensor bike'. As part of this particular study, a novel brake sensor is developed and validated in practice. The sensor package can be transferred between bicycles, allowing each rider to use his own bicycle. Results of the exploration study indicate that for the chosen descent, braking and cornering skills are not decisive for overall time over the descent. However, significant time differences are found for the corner which is analysed. Time difference reported over this corner are approximately one second. With a shortest cornering time of 10.14 seconds this is a significant difference. The brake behaviour of theWorld Tour cyclists could be split into two distinct braking strategies: \textbullet{} 'stop brake late' ( where braking is stopped late and well into the turn). \textbullet{} 'stop brake early' (where braking is stopped before or early in the turn). It was found in this study that the best brake strategy is 'stop brake late'. The peak brake forces measured during the descent are much lower than the maximum brake forces reported in literature. This implies, that performance can still be improved by increasing brake forces at the first part of the braking action, so the braking can start later. The results found in this study can contribute to optimise braking and cornering skills of riders by explaining and showing where improvements can be found. An additional result is that the brake sensor revealed unexpected brake rub at certain parts of the descent, especially when riders are accelerating. Eliminating this brake rub, can improve rider performance. The riders also shows clear signs of learning behaviour as can be observed in the obtained data. For future research it is recommended to add a speed sensor to the sensor package. Recommended small improvements for the brake sensor are identified. Using this improved sensor package, trials could be rehearsed on a steeper descent, such that pedalling actions have less influence, exploring braking and cornering strategies further.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {In this research the influence of the rower behavior and rigging setup on the boat performance is investigated in a data-driven model. There are different rowing styles and techniques between rowers. Making rowers row in synchrony, while important for the boat performance, is not easy. Rowers have their own signature rowing curve, of which only few aspects can be changed. The signature rowing curve can be based on the oar angle or the relative displacement of the rower. The latter is assumed to be constant for changes in the rigging setup and therefore preferred.\&lt;br/\&gt;The data used in this study comes from a woman's double, the rowers of which are members of the KNRB. In the boat measurements are done on the gate and foot forces, as well as the oar angles, the seat displacement and boat accelerations. \&lt;br/\&gt;From the free body diagrams of the different parts of the system, a one-dimensional rowing model is derived. The model is driven with the measured forces on the rower and the oar angles. It can be validated with the measured boat accelerations. The distribution of the masses in the system are slightly changed. All drag force on the system is assumed to be viscous and is assumed to be proportional to the square of the boat velocity. The lateral forces on the blade and the oar deformation are neglected.\&lt;br/\&gt;The relative motions of the rower are best predicted with the forces acting directly on the rower, after a compensation of the measured foot force. The best fit for the boat accelerations are found by combining the system acceleration with the relative accelerations of the rowers. \&lt;br/\&gt;With the assumption that the rower can be modeled as a force constraint model, the rigging setup of the modeled boat is changed. The blade forces have a leading role on the resulting boat motions when changing the rigging parameters. However the blade forces might not be realistically modeled. Changing the lever ratio of the oar, by increasing the inboard length leads to a bigger covered oar angle and a higher boat velocity, but a lower work per stroke applied on the handle by the rower. Moving the footstretcher towards the bow of the boat shifts the oar angle and leads to a higher boat velocity and lower handle work per stroke as well. Changing individual rigging parameters did not result in big differences between the rowers. \&lt;br/\&gt;No indications of improved synchronization between the rowers are found and the energy balance of the system is disrupted. The model simplifications of the blade forces may not be justified. After implementation of a more complex modeling of the blade forces indications of the synchronization might be found.\&lt;br/\&gt;},

  abstract = {Brake squeal is a well know problem in the bicycle industry. Most of the time brake squeal occurs due to wear of the brake components and/or in certain environmental conditions (e.g. rain and dirt). Bicycle brake squeal is often solved by trial and error. Compared to automotive industry, there is not much research done on the fundamental cause of bicycle brake squeal. As a result, bicycle brands are not able to guarantee that their bicycles will not produce squeal noise over time. The goal of this graduation project is to get more insight into the fundamental cause of bicycle brake squeal and to find the crucial parameters that influence bicycle brake squeal.},

  title = {Bicycle-Rider Control Identification},
  author = {Wendel, Koen},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Statistics show that cycling accidents have the biggest (and increasing) contribution to the overall number of hospital visits related to traffic accidents in the Netherlands. In the majority of these cycling accidents, no other road users are involved. Because the majority of the cycling accidents are so-called single vehicle accidents, understanding the control behaviour of the cyclist can spark new insight in to effective preventive measures. This thesis aims to achieve that by reviewing the current state-of-the-art in bicycle-rider control research and subsequently proposing a new rider control model that is developed using system identification techniques. The results of a literature review are used to propose a novel bicycle-rider control model structure that includes realistic human neural and cognitive characteristics to predict control behaviour for stabilizing a bicycle. Sensory integration is modelled with a Kalman filter, and human control and prediction capabilities are mimicked with a Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) and Tapped-Delay-Line predictor, respectively. Human neuromuscular dynamics are included in the model structure in the form of a second order filter and the bicycle dynamics are modelled with the linear Whipple bicycle model. Two different experimental data sets during which cyclists are laterally (roll) perturbed on instrumented bicycles are used: one collected at the UC Davis on both a horse treadmill and in a sports pavilion and the other collected at the TU Delft on a public cycling path (without other road users). The human steer response to the perturbation is separated from other effects caused by unknown disturbances and noise with a non-parametric Finite-Impulse-Response model. A structured system identification approach is used to determine the final free parameter set that approximates the non-parametric model in the best way possible. The data sets are split in a train set and a test set. The model structure is fitted to the train set. The predictive performance is verified by applying the resulting model to the test set. For the UC Davis data, the resulting model has one rider dependent parameter that describes human bicycle-balancing control behaviour for the entire evaluated forward velocity range (2-8 m/s). This parameter is the weight placed on the roll angle in the LQR control algorithm. The single-run training performance in terms of Variance-Accounted-For (VAF) with the non-parametric model reaches up to 97 \%. Test performance incurred a VAF drop, on average, of around 10 \%. The steer responses of the TU Delft experiment can be predicted with a model that has two rider dependent parameters: the weights placed on the roll angle and roll rate in LQR control algorithm. Training performance reaches up till 83 \% and test performance incurred a VAF drop, on average, of around 7\%. Promising future directions are the inclusion of a passive rider model to further increase the fidelity of the model. The investigation of the stability margins of the proposed bicycle-rider controller and their sensitivity to bicycle design and/or human sensory and cognitive decline can lead to tailored measures to reduce the injury rate among cyclists.},

  abstract = {Research in the motorcycle industry is lagging behind research in the automotive industry. Especially with respect to safety, more research is needed, since motorcycles are overrepresented in the number of road casualties and injuries. Important tools in vehicle research are vehicle simulators. The use of motorcycle simulators enables manufacturers to develop new motorcycle technologies and could make motorcycles safer. Unfortunately, few motorcycle simulators are available, and even fewer are used in the development of new motorcycles and motorcycle safety systems.\&lt;br/\&gt;This thesis evaluates the Cruden's six Degrees of Freedom (DoF) motorcycle simulator and shows that it can be used in motorcycle research. To back up this claim, it is showed that a 15-DoF multibody dynamics motorcycle model is used and that the motion platform is capable of having the rider experience dynamics associated with this dynamics model. Furthermore, a human research approach shows that participants experience the same speed perception corresponding as in real-life and that the motion platform is necessary to achieve the highest performance form the rider with respect to lane deviation. Also workload and presence in the virtual environment were significantly better with platform motion. The influence of body tracking has also been investigated but has not demonstrated significant results with respect to the rider's performance.},
