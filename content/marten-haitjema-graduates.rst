Marten Haitjema successfully defended "`Estimating fall probability in cycling
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:b7a3ff8d-de2b-47ee-ac05-61c34c1eac23>`_" on
December 14, 2023. Marten identified the linear dynamics of a robotically
balance assisted bicycle showing that the lean rate feedback controller can
stabilize the bicycle at very low speeds and that the time constant of the
instability is significantly reduced when there is a rider onboard. He then
executed an experiment to determine the probability a rider will fall when
perturbed with different magnitude forces at the handlebar. He showed that the
perturbation magnitude and number of prior perturbations were the most
important factors in determining whether one would fall. Lastly, he used these
probabilities to predict a likely reduction in fall probability when the
balance assist system is activated.

Marten was co-supervised by Leila Alizadehsaravi (TU Delft) and Jason K. Moore
(TU Delft) with assistance from Maarten Pelgrim (Gazelle), Sierd Heida
(Gazelle), Felix Dauer (Bosch), and David Gabriel (Bosch). Everyone at the
bicycle lab is very proud of Marten and wishes him the best in his next
adventures.
