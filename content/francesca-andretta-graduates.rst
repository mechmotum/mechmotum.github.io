`Francesca Andretta`_ successfully defended "`Learning cycling styles using
experimental trajectory data with Inverse Reinforcement Learning
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:41ffc288-91ce-40bc-adfc-ea6e5ba9e3dc>`_". She
developed methods to characterize whether a bicyclist was behaving more
cautiously or more aggressively in their riding style based on GPS positioning
data. Francesca was co-supervised by Azita Dabiri in the Delft Center for
Systems and Control and Jason K. Moore in BioMechanical Engineering. Everyone
at the bicycle lab is very proud of Francesca and wishes her the best!
Francesca will move into a full time position at VisionHealth_ in Munich.
