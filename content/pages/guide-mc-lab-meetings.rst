=============================

Being an MC of a Bicycle Lab Meeting is a great opportunity to contribute and
play an active role in the lab, but also to learn how to host similar meetings
in your future career.

Whether you hold the MC position for an extended period or temporarily through
a raffle or as a replacement, this guide will hopefully help you in this task.
Worst case, talk to your past MC, ask for help.

It's advised, as it's easiest, to just run through the whole list in one go on
the day of the lab meeting, while it's still fresh.

As always, you are encouraged to contribute to this guide as the function and
its responsibilities develop over time.

Lab Meeting
===========

1. Host the meeting
-------------------

- send an email with a reminder with a link to the agenda one week in advance
- welcome participants
- introduce new lab members
- ask new member for a short intro, (optional) ask current members to introduce
  their names in their AIO
- start off the AIOs: keep each one brief!
- monitor the time
- run the agenda
- run whosnext.py (`instructions <https://github.com/mechmotum/whosnext>`__)
  (you could delegate this until you get set up, ask for help setting up
  afterwards)
- announce the keynote speaker
- jot down links from presentation slides or the chat section, paste into the
  agenda notes
- help the speaker keep to the time
- thank the keynote speaker
- prepare a question to ask, either to get the question ball rolling or to
  avoid a silence
- ask audience for questions, otherwise shoot first
- thank the speaker again
- announce social activity

2. Prepare agenda for the next meeting
--------------------------------------

- on Google Drive, sign in, find the last agenda file

   - (if needed, acquire privileges from last MC)
   - (if needed, give privileges to the next MC)

- 'File/Make a Copy',
- rename to the appropriate date,
- folder: 'lab meetings'
- tick 'Share it with the same people'
- in the new file, change the date
- update the agenda based on what's been discussed
- 'Share/Get Link' (ensure: Anyone with a link / Anyone on the Internet with
  this link can edit)
- Copy Link (for the email message in the next step)

3. Send an email to the lab with the link to the new agenda file
----------------------------------------------------------------

- copy paste the last email message with the agenda as a template
- adjust as necessary
- attach links shared in the chat during the last Zoom call
- replace a link to the new agenda file
- to: mechmotum@googlegroups.com (and anyone else who is not on the mailing
  list yet)
- title: agenda for 2022-xx-xx-bicycle-lab-meeting

   - or 'x reminders + agenda for 2022-xx-xx-bicycle-lab-meeting'
   - (consistent titles help make the emails easy to find)

- (optional, when changing MCs) send a new calendar invite to the mechmotum
  group address with the updated Zoom link, delete old one

4. Update the `whosnext.py <https://github.com/mechmotum/whosnext>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------
