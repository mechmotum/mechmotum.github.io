:sortorder: 5

.. contents::

This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it. Discuss with the lab any
desires to change any of the guidelines.

Getting Started
===============

- Join the lab communication channels:

  - Ask Jason <j.k.moore@tudelft.nl> to add you to the lab `email list`_.
  - Ask Rado <r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl> to add you to the lab's element/matrix
    chat room.

- Send an introduction email to the lab email list: who you are, a bit about
  yourself, what you will work on, etc.
- Add your name and portrait to the `lab members page`_ by sending a PNG or JPG
  300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.
- Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
  be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
  recommendations.
- Attend biweekly `lab meetings <#laboratory-meetings>`_. Ask a lab member for
  the calendar invite with the video chat link. Add your ideas and votes for
  meeting topics to the google document (ask Marco for permissions to edit).
- Send out an AIO (see below) before your regular mentor meetings.
- Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
  needed). These can be requested from Jason. Ask for a tour of the space from
  a current lab member before you start working there.
- See the `recommended reading list <#recommended-reading>`_ below for some
  reading materials to get you started.

.. _lab members page: {filename}/pages/members.rst

Internship
----------

After you have found an internship, typically on your own but sometimes through
postings via the lab, here are some things you need to do:

- Review the Study Guide explanation of your internship, for example:

  - BMD: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456
  - BME: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534

- Fill out the MSc internship initiation form with your project description and
  other relevant information. Develop this project idea with your internship
  company/org contacts. If you think this aligns with Jason's research interests or
  the internship came through the bike lab you can send the form to Jason and
  ask him to be your TUD advisor. If he agrees, then you can obtain his
  signature on the form and forward it to your respective MSc coordinator.
- Make all of your internship arrangements yourself with the company (travel,
  stipend, housing, etc.)
- To receive academic credit for your internship at the end you need to write a
  report and have it assessed by your TUD internship supervisor. The short report
  should contain aspects aligned with those described in this rubric:
  https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf.
  This rubric will not be used to determine your grade, it is simply pass/fail
  based on the supervisor's review.
- You also need your external internship supervisor to fill out the form
  "INTERNSHIP ASSESSMENT FORM FOR EXTERNAL PARTIES" and submit the completed
  version to your TUD supervisor.
- Note that your TUD supervisor is typically not involved in your internship
  other than the signing the initial form and assessing and providing a grade
  at the end.

Literature Study
----------------

- Review the `Literature Study learning objectives and rubric
  <https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/3ME/Onderwijs/GERELATEERD/Formulieren/Rubric%20MSc%20Literature%20Review.pdf>`_
- Read "`How to read a paper`_" and "`Guide to writing a literature review for Science and Technology students`_"
- Choose and learn a tool/method to organize your papers and notes (e.g.
  Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote, Excel)
- First goal is to read a large quantity of paper abstracts (phase 1 in "How to
  Read a Paper") to get a broad sense of what people are researching about the
  topics of interest
- Second goal is to formulate a research question(s) that you can answer with
  your literature study
- Third goal is to delve deeper into papers that are closely related to your
  research question
- Lastly, write up your findings in a way that answers your research question.
- As you approach the finish of your literature study you should schedule your
  colloquium, where you will present the results of your literature study and
  possible some of your thesis plan.

MSc Thesis
----------

- If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
  sensitive information you will need to arrange the "Graduation Agreement at a
  Company" that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
  here here:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/.
  Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.

COVID-Time Lab Rules
====================

Use of the bicycle lab for hands-on project work is allowed as long as 3mE
allows this type of work inside the building. Check with Jason for the
up-to-date rules if in question. The current lab rules are:

- All the `University rules
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/coronavirus/>`_ and `3mE rules
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/current/information-coronavirus/>`_ apply and
  the following rules are in addition to those.
- No more than 6 people working in the lab at any given time. If you need to
  visit the lab briefly and there are 6 people present, ask if the people
  present are comfortable with you entering when arriving.
- You are expected to maintain 1.5 m distance between everyone present in the
  lab and use face masks when you are not seated.
- If you are sick, stay home and get tested. Let others you were in contact
  with know immediately of possible or confirmed COVID infection to prevent
  spread.
- Take the virus seriously and respect everyone's health needs/wishes. Everyone
  should feel comfortable if using the space. Communication is key for this.

Communication
=============

Lab Email List
   When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

   This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
   discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
   for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion.
Text, Audio, Video Chat Room
   We host a matrix_ server which can be accessed using https://element.io or
   any other supported clients_. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
   We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
   transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
Issue Trackers
   We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communication.
   This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
   organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
   repository (in addition to the website issues):

   https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Quarterly Blog Posts
   In general, we would like each project to write regular blog posts for the
   lab website. These posts should describe updates on project progress and
   results. This writing exercise will help build the content for future papers
   and theses and provide outreach to the public about our work. It is helpful
   to do these on a schedule (quarterly, semi-annually, etc.) so that the get
   done. If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll need to select
   aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo the blog post
   to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.

.. _matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _clients: https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/

AIO Weekly Emails
-----------------

Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to their supervisor(s) and any
project collaborators you meet with during your regular meetings.

"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with your daily supervisor
and anyone involved in your project outside the lab. Some notes:

- If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.
- The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.
- No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.
- It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
  suggestion so everyone can learn and discuss.
- The AIOs are not a contest. Your supervisor is not collecting these to judge
  how much you accomplish, but they do care that you are working, attempting to
  make progress, and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had
  vacation that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just
  note that.
- If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
  reader to understand the problem.

The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the supervisor. It can be
before (we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the
issues with me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post
meeting. Some students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after
meeting with the supervisor. However you do it, each week the accomplishments
should hopefully reflect the objectives you wrote the previous week.

Laboratory Meetings
===================

We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have a designated person
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.

The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:

- 10-20 minute presentation with Q & A
- tutorial
- have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)
- watch and discuss a video
- invite a speaker
- play a game
- practice your colloquia or conference talks
- bicycle-themed stand-up
- etc.

Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.

The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the `MC Guide`_ for
instructions on being the MC.

Research Ideas
==============

Specific MSc project advertisements can be found on the `jobs
<{filename}/pages/jobs.rst>`_.

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

Have a look at current and past projects on the `research page
<{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_

Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public, ask, otherwise please default to sharing early and often. We do work
with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject data, student
protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the involved
parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that should be
discussed at the beginning of all projects.

TU Delft offers several resources for open science:

- `TU Delft Library Open Science <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/>`_
- `Open Access Publishing Information <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing/>`_
- `TU Delft 2020-2024 Open Science Strategic Plan <https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f2faff07-408f-4cec-bd87-0919c9e4c26f>`_
- `You Share, We Take Care! <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care/>`_
- `Open Science Community Delft <https://osc-delft.github.io/>`_
- `TU Delft Open Science Portal <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/openscience>`_

Research Tools Contributions
----------------------------

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.

.. _Pelican: getpelican.com

Software Tools
==============

Reference Management
--------------------

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.

.. _Zotero: https://www.zotero.org
.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
---------------

The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum
- https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab

The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

**Private repositories** are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.

.. _Git lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

Lab Space
=========

Using, removing, loaning equipment & consumables
------------------------------------------------

If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!

If a TU Delft student or staff that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab, find out if anyone is using it (as noted above), and
then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the lab door) with their
name, email, and date before the item leaves the lab. When they return the
item, indicate the return date on the sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member
students should look to the more general shared equipment resources available
in 3mE before borrowing from us and we don't generally loan common things like
screwdrivers and bike pumps but can loan specialized equipment that only we
have.

If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for **more than one day** you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.

If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution.

Training
========

It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.

Useful TU Delft MSc Courses
---------------------------

Multibody Dynamics B
   Core high level dynamics principles that are the foundation for almost every
   project in the lab.
Special Topics Course in Sports Engineering
   TU Delft organizes an annual two week course to train students in sports
   engineering. Cycling has been used as the motivating topic to learn the
   methods.
Musculoskeletal Modelling and Simulation ME41005
   Learn how to develop and utilized computational neuromuscular models with
   OpenSim. Many projects in the lab make use of neuromuscular and
   biomechanical modeling.

The Carpentries Trainings
-------------------------

Each lab member will need to learn the collaborative software tools and open
source development practices needed to work on code and other text based
sources together. Carpentries trainings (Software Carpentry in particular) is a
great way to get started on this. TU Delft offers regular courses:

- `Software Carpentry Workshops
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshop/>`_

Sign up by emailing Femke van Giessen (F.vanGiessen@tudelft.nl) to register for
a slot. You will be directed to an Evenbrite. Sign up on Eventbrite immediately
because these typically fill up in 10 minutes and there are large wait lists.

- TU Delft Data Champions hosts events and trainings:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/support/data-champions/
- 4TU Research Data Training and Events:
  https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/news-events/training-events/

Writing Help
------------

`TU Delft Writing Center`_
   Schedule a meeting with a writing coach to get advice on your thesis or
   other documents.

.. _TU Delft Writing Center: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/staff-departments/centre-for-languages-and-academic-skills/education/writing-centre

Connecting to Research Communities
==================================

We regularly participate in several research communities.

Online
------

`Biomech-L forum <https://biomch-l.isbweb.org>`_
  A 30+ year old public discussion forum to connect to the international
  Biomechanics community. Lot's of great scientific discussions.
`Single Track Vehicle Dynamics listserv <https://groups.google.com/g/stvdy>`_
   Public email based forum for discussing the dynamics and control of single
   track vehicles.

Software
--------

R-Ladies Rotterdam
   https://www.meetup.com/rladies-rotterdam/
Pythonistas-NL
   https://www.meetup.com/Pythonistas-NL/

Conferences
-----------

PhDs and Postdocs should submit to and present at conferences each year, if
possible. MSc and BSc students are also encouraged to do so if resources allow.

`Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference <http://bmdconf.org/>`_
   This conference is the most closely related to the bicycle lab's core
   research in single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control. The
   conference series ordinated with Arend Schwab and his colleagues and was
   launched in 2010 in Delft. The lab should make a strong effort every three
   years to submit to and be involved in this conference.
`International Cycling Safety Conference <http://cyclingsafety.net/>`_
   This is the next most important conference to be involved in. We should aim
   to have at least one or two submissions to this conference each year.
ECCOMAS Multibody Dynamics Conference
   This is a good conference for presenting topics that focus in multibody
   dynamics methods.
`International Sports Engineering Conference <https://www.sportsengineering.org/events/conference/>`_
   This is the best conference to submit sports engineering topics. It is held
   every other year. There are likely many other TU Delft participants,
   especially through the Sports Engineering Institute.
`International Society of Biomechanics Congresses <https://isbweb.org/activities/congresses>`_
   Huge annual conference with a broad array of biomechanics topics. Great
   networking and a catch all for many topics from the lab. Every two years.
`SciPy <https://conference.scipy.org/>`_ & `EuroSciPY <https://www.euroscipy.org/>`_
   Annual conferences. If your work involves open source Python software these
   are a great place to showcase the advances in library development and use of
   the tools.
Dutch Bio-Medical Engineering Conference
   Nice way to connect with Dutch local researchers.

Funding Opportunities
=====================

`Dekker-Padget Internshiup Program: Dutch2USA <https://thenaf.org/dutch2usa-internship-program/>`_
   Funding for minority or economically disadvantaged college students to do an
   internship in the USA.
`Veni <https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme>`_
   The Veni is part of the NWO's Talent Programme. It is the first of three
   personal grants. Postdocs in the lab that plan to continue in academia
   should apply for this. Final year PhDs are also encouraged to apply too. If
   you get this grant, you will gain a strong advantage in moving your academic
   career forward in the Netherlands. If you don't, you'll have practiced
   developing your personal research vision and goals, which is also extremely
   valuable.

Recommended Reading
===================

Your projects will vary and you'll have to read a variety of different papers
and resources, but this list provides a general set of papers that it is good
for all lab members to read.

Introduction to Bicycle Dynamics
--------------------------------

|Astrom2005|
   IEEE control systems magazine article that introduces bicycle dynamics with
   a few different models and nice explanation of important control principles.
|Meijaard2007|
   Shows the fundamental bicycle model we typically start with for
   understanding lateral dynamics of single track vehicles. Introduces much of
   the important terminology and principles.
|Sharp2008|
   Robin Sharp developed one of the most widely cited motorcycle dynamics
   models in 1970 (also recommended read), but this paper is his take on
   bicycle dynamics, stability, and control after many years of work on the
   topic of single track vehicle dynamics. It also lays out a number of core
   principles for the study of lateral dynamics of bicycles.
