This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it to do so. Discuss with the
lab any desires to change any of the guidelines.

Getting Started
===============

- Join the lab communication channels:

  - Ask Jason <j.k.moore@tudelft.nl> to add you to the lab `email list`_.
  - Ask Rado <r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl> to add you to the lab's element/matrix
    chat room.

- Send an introduction email to the lab email list
  (mechmotum@googlegroups.com): who you are, a bit about yourself, what you
  will work on, etc.
- Add your name and portrait to the `lab members page`_ by sending a PNG or JPG
  300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.
- Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
  be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
  recommendations.
- Attend biweekly `lab meetings <#laboratory-meetings>`_. Ask a lab member for
  the calendar invite with the video chat link.
- Send out an AIO (see below) before your regular mentor meetings if requested
  by your supervisors.
- Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
  needed). These can be requested from Jason. Ask for a tour of the space from
  a current lab member before you start working there.
- Request access to the lab's shared Google Drive from Jason.
- We have the optional "Cheese for Thought" lunch every Thursday at 12:00, meet
  at the lab. This is a chance to discuss topics informally.
- Every other week (opposite lab meeting weeks) we go for snacks and drinks in
  Delft on Fridays @ 17:00.
- See the `recommended reading list <#recommended-reading>`_ below for some
  reading materials to get you started.

Masters Students
================

MSc General
-----------

- We expect you to take the lead in your project. Your supervisors are here to
  advise and guide you, but it is up to you to manage your time, relationships,
  work, etc.
- BME and BMD MSc students now have some new excellent guidance documents with
  flowcharts available on the "Master Biomedical Engineering" and "Master
  Biomechanical Design" Brightspace courses under "Flowcharts & Guidance Docs".
  Please read these and reference them regularly. The guide here is a
  compliment to those documents.
- You are encouraged to join the "Graduation Community Program" for get
  togethers and workshops on topics to help you move through your MSc. This is
  especially helpful if you are struggling in your MSc.
- Review the `Data Management Guide
  <{filename}/pages/guide-data-management.rst>`_.

Internship
----------

15 ECs (420 hours, ~10 weeks full time)

After you have found an internship, typically on your own but sometimes through
postings via the lab, here are some things you need to do:

- Review the Study Guide explanation of your internship, for example:

  - BMD: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456
  - BME: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534

- Review the internship forms and guidelines (always use up-to-date forms):
  https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms
- Fill out the MSc internship initiation form with your project description and
  other relevant information. Develop this project idea with your internship
  company/org contacts. If you think this aligns with Jason's research
  interests or the internship came through the bike lab you can send the form
  to Jason and ask him to be your TUD advisor. If he agrees, then you can
  obtain his signature on the form and forward it to your respective MSc
  coordinator.
- Make all of your internship arrangements yourself with the company (travel,
  stipend, housing, IP, NDA, etc.). Reach out to your TUD supervisor if you
  need help in any of these aspects.
- To receive academic credit for your internship at the end you need to write a
  report and have it assessed by your TUD internship supervisor. The short report
  should contain aspects aligned with those described in this rubric:
  https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf
  and the direction and needs of your external internship supervisor. This rubric
  will not be used to determine your grade, it is simply pass/fail based on the
  supervisor's review.
- You also need your external internship supervisor to fill out the form
  "INTERNSHIP ASSESSMENT FORM FOR EXTERNAL PARTIES" and submit the completed
  version to your TUD supervisor.
- Note that your TUD supervisor is typically not involved in your internship
  other than the signing the initial form and assessing and providing a grade
  at the end. The purpose of the internship is for you to get some non-academic
  experience in engineering. The internship should also be distinct from your
  MSc literature study and thesis project in the sense that a standalone report
  for the internship work is required.

Here are some companies and organizations that have hosted internships with us
in the past: Gazelle, Prinoth, Garmin/Tacx, Swugo, B-Cells, Team DSM, SymPy,
Bikefitting.com, TrueKinetix, velolab.de, TU Delft Sports Engineering
Institute, Aalborg University Sports Sciences.

Literature Study
----------------

10 ECs (280 hours, ~7 weeks full time)

- If you are a BMD or BME student, read the relevant guidance docs found on
  Brightspace.
- Arrange an initial meeting with your supervisor(s) to discuss how to get
  started on the literature study and to discuss the general topic area of the
  study.
- Review the "MSc Literature Review Assessment Rubric" on the `3mE MSc Forms`_
  page.
- Read "How to read a paper" and "Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Literature
  Review" and review the "The Literature Review Process" website in the
  recommended reading section below.
- Choose and learn a tool/method to organize your papers and notes (e.g.
  Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote, Excel).
- The first goal is to read a large quantity of paper abstracts (phase 1 in
  "How to Read a Paper") to get a broad sense of what people are researching
  about the topics of interest.
- The second goal is to formulate a research question(s) that you can likely
  answer with the papers you read.
- Once you have a research question in mind, arrange a meeting with your
  supervisors to formally present the question and receive feedback (this
  should occur within the first two weeks of work). You should prepare a slide
  presentation or similar.
- The third goal is to delve deep into papers that are closely related to your
  research question, analyze and critique them, and synthesize the knowledge
  you obtain from them into a coherent answer to you research question.
- Before writing your report read "The Science of Scientific Writing" and "How
  to write a good (enough) report" in the recommend reading section below.
- Lastly, write up your findings for a technical audience in a way that answers
  your research question.
- Once you have a first full draft of the literature study, request feedback
  from your supervisors. This usually takes a week. You can arrange a meeting
  to receive verbal feedback also. Use the feedback to improve your document
  and then submit it to your supervisors for their official assessment and
  grade.
- As you approach the finish of your literature study you should schedule your
  colloquium, where you will present the results of your literature study to
  your peers. We encourage you to practice your colloquia with an ad hoc group
  from the lab or at a lab meeting. Send an invite to your colloquia to the
  lab.

.. _3mE MSc Forms: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/msc-forms/

MSc Thesis
----------

35 ECs (980 hours, ~25 weeks full time)

Basic Steps:

- Submit MSc initiation form (BME/BMD form 4, other tracks may have a different
  form. You may do this at the start of your literature study, if appropriate.
- Formulate a research question or hypothesis that you'd like address in
  consultation with your supervisors (this usually occurs in the later portion
  of your literature study period and is informed by your literature study
  findings).
- Develop a written project plan (3 pages): research question/aim/goals,
  your basic technical approach, timeline, milestones, resources, etc.
- Organize a kickoff meeting with all of your supervisors to formally present
  your research project and project plan. This should be slide presentation or
  similar.
- Adjust your project plan based on the feedback at the kickoff meeting.
- Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.
- Present your progress at a midterm meeting with all of your supervisors. The
  midterm should occur after you have significant preliminary results that
  demonstrate you can succeed in the final project execution.
- Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.
- Once you are getting close to a draft thesis arrange a Go/No-Go meeting. This
  meeting should include all of your supervisors that will be on your defense
  committee. Typically give the supervisors one week to read and comment on the
  draft before the meeting. Prepare a (strictly) 10 minute slide presentation
  to get everyone up to speed at the beginning of the meeting.
- If you get a "Go" at the Go/No-Go meeting then you should initiate the
  arrangement of your defense by submitting the correct forms to your track
  coordinators and department secretaries.
- If you get a "No-Go", at the Go/No-Go meeting then take the supervisors'
  feedback and improve your work until you are ready for another Go/No-Go
  meeting.
- When you have a "Go", edit your thesis based on the supervisors' feedback.
  When you have a final version of your thesis, send it to your supervisors two
  weeks before the defense and submit it to the TU Delft Education Repository.
  Make sure to add an embargo if your work requires one.
- Follow the `Data Management Guide
  <{filename}/pages/guide-data-management.rst>`_ and deliver your project
  assets to the lab principle investigator and any partner organizations.

Other:

- Always use up-to-date forms from here:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me%E2%80%90student%E2%80%90portal/education/related/student%E2%80%90forms/msc%E2%80%90forms/
- If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
  sensitive information you will need to arrange the "Graduation Agreement at a
  Company" that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
  here here:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/.
  Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.
- Read the articles about writing reports and theses in the recommended reading
  later in this guide.

COVID-Time Lab Rules
====================

Use of the bicycle lab for hands-on project work is allowed as long as 3mE
allows this type of work inside the building. Check with Jason for the
up-to-date rules if in question. The current lab rules are:

- All the University rules and 3mE rules apply and the following rules are in
  addition to those.
- If you are sick, stay home and get tested. Let others you were in contact
  with know immediately of possible or confirmed COVID infection to prevent
  spread. Follow the Dutch government recommendations and regulations.
- Take the virus seriously and respect everyone's health needs/wishes. Everyone
  should feel comfortable if using the space. Communication is key for this.

Communication
=============

Lab Email List
   When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

   This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
   discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
   for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion. Write to the
   email list by sending a message to mechmotum@googlegroups.com.
Text, Audio, Video Chat Room
   We host a matrix_ server which can be accessed using https://element.io or
   any other supported clients_. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
   We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
   transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
   There are a number of rooms that you can join where we share papers,
   conference announcements, etc.
Issue Trackers
   We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communicate.
   This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
   organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
   repository (in addition to the website issues):

   https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Quarterly Blog Posts
   In general, we would like each project to write at least one blog post for
   the lab website. This post should at least describe project results. This
   writing exercise will help build the content for future papers and theses
   and provide outreach to the public about our work. If you write more than
   one blog post, it is helpful to do these on a schedule (quarterly,
   semi-annually, etc.). If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll
   need to select aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo
   the blog post to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.

.. _matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _clients: https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/

AIO Weekly Emails
-----------------

Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to their supervisor(s) and any
project collaborators you meet with during your regular meetings if agreed upon
with your supervisor.

"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with your daily supervisor
and anyone involved in your project outside the lab. Some notes:

- If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.
- The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.
- No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.
- It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
  suggestion so everyone can learn and discuss.
- The AIOs are not a contest. Your supervisor is not collecting these to judge
  how much you accomplish, but they do care that you are working, attempting to
  make progress, and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had
  vacation that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just
  note that.
- If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
  reader to understand the problem.

The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the supervisor. It can be
before (we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the
issues with me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post
meeting. Some students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after
meeting with the supervisor. However you do it, each week the accomplishments
should hopefully reflect the objectives you wrote the previous week.

Laboratory Meetings
===================

We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have a designated person
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.

The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:

- 10-20 minute presentation with Q & A
- tutorial
- have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)
- watch and discuss a video
- invite a speaker
- play a game
- practice your colloquia or conference talks
- bicycle-themed stand-up
- etc.

Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.

The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the `MC Guide`_ for
instructions on being the MC.

Research Ideas
==============

Specific MSc project advertisements can be found on the `jobs
<{filename}/pages/jobs.rst>`_.

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

Have a look at current and past projects on the `research page
<{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_

Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public ask you supervisor, otherwise please default to sharing early and often.
We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject
data, student protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the
involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that
should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.

TU Delft offers several resources for open science:

- `TU Delft Library Open Science <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/>`_
- `Open Access Publishing Information <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing/>`_
- `TU Delft 2020-2024 Open Science Strategic Plan <https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f2faff07-408f-4cec-bd87-0919c9e4c26f>`_
- `You Share, We Take Care! <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care/>`_
- `Open Science Community Delft <https://osc-delft.github.io/>`_
- `TU Delft Open Science Portal <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/openscience>`_

Research Tools Contributions
----------------------------

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.

.. _Pelican: getpelican.com

Software Tools
==============

Shared Cloud Space
------------------

We have a directory named "Fietslab Commons" on Google Drive. To access this,
request that it be shared with you by your supervisor. This folder and it's
contents should only be shared with other ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` addresses
that are members of the lab. ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` is also the login
username/email that you will need to use when logging into
https://drive.google.com. Please avoid using the "Share" button to share with
non-TUD accounts, until we determine best practices for this. Read and update
the README files present in the Google Drive directories to learn how to use
the space. If you create new directories, add a README file to explain what the
purpose of the folder is. If you want to add large amounts of data (>10 Gb),
inform your supervisor first because there may be a more appropriate long term
storage solution for certain types of data.

Reference Management
--------------------

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.

.. _Zotero: https://www.zotero.org
.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
---------------

The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum
- https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab

The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

**Private repositories** are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.

.. _Git lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

Lab Space
=========

Equipment & Consumables
-----------------------

If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!

If a TU Delft student or staff that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab, find out if anyone is using it (as noted above), and
then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the lab door) with their
name, email, date, and your name (as the responsible person) before the item
leaves the lab. When they return the item, indicate the return date on the
sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member students should look to the more
general shared equipment resources available in 3mE before borrowing from us
and we don't generally loan common things like screwdrivers and bike pumps but
can loan specialized equipment that only we have.

If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for **more than one day** you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.

If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution. Your caution and carefulness should be proportionate to
the cost of the lab equipment. Treat things as if they were your own and you
paid for it.

Purchasing
----------

If the lab needs basic office supplies or computer supplies, a request should
be made to the secretary. Don't purchase these yourself, because they should be
purchased through the university vendors.

If you need some lab supplies or equipment for your project, talk with your
supervisor about it and they can order what you need if there are funds
available.

TU Delft 3mE VAT number: NL 001569569B01

Equipment Inventory
-------------------

When new equipment arrives in the lab, the receiver is responsible for
inventorying the equipment. This only needs to be done for items that cost more
than 250 EUR. The basic steps are:

- Log the equipment in the inventory spreadsheet on the shared Google Drive.
  This should include product name, manufacturer, serial number, manufacturer
  contact info, value, etc. (fill out the existing columns or make new ones if
  needed).
- Make a folder in the Google Drive for the product and deposit any
  documentation.
- If the item doesn't have a storage container, obtain one so that it can
  neatly be stored in the lab and things don't get lost. Leave paper
  documentation in the container.
- Permanently mark the item(s) and container with "TU Delft Bicycle Lab" (use a
  paint pen, inscribing tool, etc.)
- As you learn the device, leave any relevant documentation you obtain or
  create in the Google Drive folder so that future users can learn from your
  work. Include the manufacturer's documents as well as your personal tips and
  explanations on using the equipment. If any documentation is more appropriate
  for storing and tracking with version control, then add that to a lab owned
  Git repository.

Training
========

It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.

Useful TU Delft MSc Courses
---------------------------

Multibody Dynamics B
   Core high level dynamics principles that are the foundation for almost every
   project in the lab.
Special Topics Course in Sports Engineering
   TU Delft organizes an annual two week course to train students in sports
   engineering. Cycling has been used as the motivating topic to learn the
   methods.
Musculoskeletal Modelling and Simulation (ME41005)
   Learn how to develop and utilized computational neuromuscular models with
   OpenSim. Many projects in the lab make use of neuromuscular and
   biomechanical modeling.
Vehicle Dynamics and Control (RO47017)
   Provides various fundamentals for understanding vehicle motion and how to
   control it. Focused on automobiles but many concepts transfer to single
   track vehicles.
System Identification and Parameter Estimation (ME41065)
   We often make use system identification and parameter estimation for both
   vehicle and human control models.
Automatic Flight Control System Design (AE4301)
   There are many similarities in single track vehicle control and aircraft
   control. This course also covers some topics on aircraft handling qualities
   which we make use of in understanding single track vehicle handling
   qualities.

The Carpentries Trainings
-------------------------

Each lab member will need to learn the collaborative software tools and open
source development practices needed to work on code and other text based
sources together. Carpentries trainings (Software Carpentry in particular) is a
great way to get started on this. TU Delft offers regular courses:

- `Software Carpentry Workshops
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshop/>`_

Sign up by emailing Femke van Giessen (F.vanGiessen@tudelft.nl) to register for
a slot. You will be directed to an Evenbrite. Sign up on Eventbrite immediately
because these typically fill up in 10 minutes and there are large wait lists.

- TU Delft Data Champions hosts events and trainings:

Conferences
-----------

PhDs and Postdocs should submit to and present at conferences each year, if
possible. MSc and BSc students are also encouraged to do so if resources allow.

`Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference <http://bmdconf.org/>`_
   This conference is the most closely related to the bicycle lab's core
   research in single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control. The
   conference series ordinated with Arend Schwab and his colleagues and was
   launched in 2010 in Delft. The lab should make a strong effort every three
   years to submit to and be involved in this conference.
`International Cycling Safety Conference <http://cyclingsafety.net/>`_
   This is the next most important conference to be involved in. We should aim
   to have at least one or two submissions to this conference each year.
ECCOMAS Multibody Dynamics Conference
   This is a good conference for presenting topics that focus in multibody
   dynamics methods.
`International Sports Engineering Conference <https://www.sportsengineering.org/events/conference/>`_
   This is the best conference to submit sports engineering topics. It is held
   every other year. There are likely many other TU Delft participants,
   especially through the Sports Engineering Institute.
`International Society of Biomechanics Congresses <https://isbweb.org/activities/congresses>`_
   Huge annual conference with a broad array of biomechanics topics. Great
   networking and a catch all for many topics from the lab. Every two years.
`SciPy <https://conference.scipy.org/>`_ & `EuroSciPY <https://www.euroscipy.org/>`_
   Annual conferences. If your work involves open source Python software these
   are a great place to showcase the advances in library development and use of
   the tools.
Dutch Bio-Medical Engineering Conference
   Nice way to connect with Dutch local researchers.

Funding Opportunities
=====================

`Dekker-Padget Internshiup Program: Dutch2USA <https://thenaf.org/dutch2usa-internship-program/>`_
   Funding for minority or economically disadvantaged college students to do an
   internship in the USA.
`Veni <https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme>`_
   The Veni is part of the NWO's Talent Programme. It is the first of three
   personal grants. Postdocs in the lab that plan to continue in academia
   should apply for this. Final year PhDs are also encouraged to apply too. If
   you get this grant, you will gain a strong advantage in moving your academic
   career forward in the Netherlands. If you don't, you'll have practiced
   developing your personal research vision and goals, which is also extremely
   valuable.
