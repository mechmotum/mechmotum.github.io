This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it to do so. Discuss with the
lab any desires to change any of the guidelines.

Getting Started
===============

- Join the lab communication channels: Ask Jason <j.k.moore@tudelft.nl> to add
  you to the lab `email list`_ and someone in the lab how to join the lab's
  element/matrix chat room or read the instrutions in the Google Drive "How to
  join the Element/Matrix chat room".
- Send an introduction email to the lab email list
  (mechmotum@googlegroups.com): who you are, a bit about yourself, what you
  will work on, etc.
- Add your name and portrait to the `lab members page`_ by sending a PNG or JPG
  300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.
- Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
  be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
  recommendations.
- Attend biweekly `lab meetings <#laboratory-meetings>`_. Ask a lab member for
  the calendar invite with the video chat link.
- Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
  needed). These can be requested from Jason by sending him an email with your
  student ID number, TU Delft email address, and expected duration of access.
  Ask for a tour of the space from a current lab member before you start
  working there.
- Request access to the lab's shared Google Drive from Jason.
- We have the optional "Cheese for Thought" lunch every Wednesday at 12:00,
  meet at the lab. This is a chance to discuss topics informally.
- Every other week (opposite lab meeting weeks) we go for snacks and drinks in
  Delft on Fridays @ 17:00.
- See the `recommended reading list <#recommended-reading>`_ below for some
  reading materials to get you started.

Employees
=========

Postdocs, PhDs, and other staff

- You are expected to attend the lab meetings and other common lab work
  sessions (e.g. lab cleanup) unless you are sick or on holiday.
- You are expected to spend some of your time to help Jason manage and organize
  the lab and research group. In particular, you should help improve and
  maintain the website, help tidy, organize, and clean the lab space, keep
  physical equipment maintained and running.
- If you are not able to work at standard capacity, you must take sick leave or
  holiday leave.
- If you need to take sick leave, report this to your immediate supervisor and
  the secretariat when you become sick. When you return, also inform your
  immediate supervisor and secretariat. Make sure your sick leave hours are
  logged in TIM.
- All holiday time has to be requested via TIM and approved by the department
  manager. You must  take your holiday time before the end of your contract.
  Note that you can sell some holiday time (up to 38 hrs/year via IKA).  If you
  decide to take a holiday please inform Jason by email so he are aware
  you are unavailable and can mark it on his calendar. If you are going to take a
  week or more at a time, please inform your supervisor well in advance for
  planning purposes so we can cover any of your duties.
- TU Delft's policy is that you can work from home 2 days per week if your
  supervisor approves. The other 3 days should be on campus. You have Jason's
  blanket permission to work from home or other locations the equivalent of 2
  days per week. If you want to work from home more that this, discuss with
  Jason. You should, in general, complete your contracted work hours during
  typical working hours 8-6 so that you can interact with the lab members. When
  you work from home you should be easily reachable by email, phone, or video
  chat, etc.
- You likely have a budget associated with your position or projects. Ask Jason
  or the relevant supervisor to tell you this budget. You can mange your own
  budget and don't need to ask permission for purchasing things < 250 EUR. If
  you need to spend more than that, then inform your immediate supervisor of
  the purchase before purchasing so there are no surprises. The secretariat can
  purchase items for you or you can purchase items and request reimbursement.
- Work related travel outside of the Netherlands must be pre approved via
  Digiforms and pre-approved by Jason.
- Postdocs will have an annual review with your supervisors (R&O). These should
  occur in the first quarter of the year. It is up to you to make sure this is
  scheduled. PhDs follow the graduate school review process and do not have
  R&O's.
- Postdocs may use 20% of their contracted time to pursue their academic and
  career endeavors not related to their contracted work, e.g. finishing papers
  from their PhD or gaining teaching experience, given that progress on your
  contracted project is satisfactory. Discuss workload with Jason if you are
  not able to take advantage of this as you desire and we will do our best to
  make this possible, but this is mostly dependent on your ability to be
  efficient with your primary research tasks.
- If you supervise BSc, MSc, or PhD students that regularly use the lab
  resources and/or Jason is the main supervisor of, those students need to
  follow join the Bicycle Lab and follow the expectations in this guide.

Communication
=============

Lab Email List
   When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

   This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
   discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
   for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion. Write to the
   email list by sending a message to mechmotum@googlegroups.com.
Text, Audio, Video Chat Room
   We host a matrix_ server which can be accessed using https://element.io or
   any other supported clients_. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
   We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
   transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
   There are a number of rooms that you can join where we share papers,
   conference announcements, etc.
Issue Trackers
   We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communicate.
   This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
   organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
   repository (in addition to the website issues):

   https://github.com/mechmotum/housekeeping

Quarterly Blog Posts
   In general, we would like each project to write at least one blog post for
   the lab website. This post should at least describe project results. This
   writing exercise will help build the content for future papers and theses
   and provide outreach to the public about our work. If you write more than
   one blog post, it is helpful to do these on a schedule (quarterly,
   semi-annually, etc.). If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll
   need to select aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo
   the blog post to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.

.. _matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _clients: https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/

Laboratory Meetings
===================

We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have a designated person
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.

The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:

- 10-20 minute presentation with Q & A
- tutorial
- have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)
- watch and discuss a video
- invite a speaker
- play a game
- practice your colloquia or conference talks
- bicycle-themed stand-up
- etc.

Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.

The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the `MC Guide`_ for
instructions on being the MC.

.. _MC Guide: {filename}/pages/guide-mc-lab-meetings.rst

At lab meetings we do a quick round of AIOs. "AIO" stands for Accomplishments,
Issues, and Objectives. Be prepared to give a brief updated on:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

See the `archive of past meetings <{filename}/pages/lab-meetings-archive.rst>`_
for prior topics and examples.

Research Ideas
==============

Specific MSc project advertisements can be found on the `jobs
<{filename}/pages/jobs.rst>`_.

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

Have a look at current and past projects on the `research page
<{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_

Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public ask you supervisor, otherwise please default to sharing early and often.
We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject
data, student protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the
involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that
should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.

TU Delft offers several resources for open science:

- `TU Delft Library Open Science <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/>`_
- `Open Access Publishing Information <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing/>`_
- `TU Delft 2020-2024 Open Science Strategic Plan <https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f2faff07-408f-4cec-bd87-0919c9e4c26f>`_
- `You Share, We Take Care! <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care/>`_
- `Open Science Community Delft <https://osc-delft.github.io/>`_
- `TU Delft Open Science Portal <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/openscience>`_

Research Tools Contributions
----------------------------

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.

.. _Pelican: getpelican.com

Software Tools
==============

Shared Cloud Space
------------------

We have a directory named "Fietslab Commons" on Google Drive. To access this,
request that it be shared with you by your supervisor. This folder and it's
contents should only be shared with other ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` addresses
that are members of the lab. ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` is also the login
username/email that you will need to use when logging into
https://drive.google.com. Please avoid using the "Share" button to share with
non-TUD accounts, until we determine best practices for this. Read and update
the README files present in the Google Drive directories to learn how to use
the space. If you create new directories, add a README file to explain what the
purpose of the folder is. If you want to add large amounts of data (>10 Gb),
inform your supervisor first because there may be a more appropriate long term
storage solution for certain types of data.

Reference Management
--------------------

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.

.. _Zotero: https://www.zotero.org
.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
---------------

The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum
- https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab

The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

**Private repositories** are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.

Our Software
------------

This presentation gives a basic overview over the set of software packages
we've developed:

   frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"
   mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

Lab Space
=========

Tidiness
--------

- The lab should be kept clean and tidy.
- Place small trash into the two bins and paper into the blue box for pickup by
  the janitors.
- Place large trash, paper, cardboard outside in the bins near the bike cage.
  Do not leave this lying in the floor of the bike lab. It will not be picked
  up.
- Always leave the lab cleaner and tidier than you found it. If followed, this
  will tend towards a clean and tidy lab instead of the opposite.
- Always clean up before the end of a work day (reserve last 15 minutes to do
  so).
- Put items and tools back in their labeled locations. If there isn't a label
  or location, make one.

Safety
------

Our goal is to have ZERO injuries in the lab. Safety should be taken seriously
and always prioritized. Some key things:

- Wear safety glasses and other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
  when using tools. These are available in the lab or can be borrowed from the
  workshop. Contact your supervisor if we need more PPE.
- Do not use tools that you are not familiar with. Always ask someone to show
  you proper use.
- Any activities that have potential to cause injury performed outside of the
  8:00-17:00 weekday (non-holiday) times should always have two people present.
  During the workday period it is recommended to have a buddy present when
  doing anything can cause injury, but the number of people in the halls and
  glass walls make this optional.
- The large treadmill **always** has to have two people for operation. When the
  treadmill is operating the walker/rider must be wearing the harness properly
  and the operator must have their hand on the kill switch. Ensure that objects
  cannot fly off the back of the treadmill.
- Human subject experiments must have an HREC plan and protocol (always for
  PhD, Postdoc and at minimum approval from your supervisors for MSc).
- If you are ever asking yourself "should I do this?", that's probably a good
  signal that you shouldn't. Get help, advice, training, etc. so that you do
  your activity safely.

Equipment & Consumables
-----------------------

If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!

If a TU Delft staff or student that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab for TU Delft research, find out if anyone is using it
(as noted above), and then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the
lab door) with their name, email, date, and your name (as the responsible
person) before the item leaves the lab. When they return the item, indicate the
return date on the sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member students and staff
should look to the more general shared equipment resources available in ME
before borrowing from us. Do not loan common things like screwdrivers and
general tools, as those can be borrowed from the faculty machine shops. In
general, do not loan our bike tools out, researchers that need them can come to
the bike lab and use them. Do not loan tools or equipment for people's personal
use.

If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for **more than one day** you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.

If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution. Your caution and carefulness should be proportionate to
the cost of the lab equipment. Treat things as if they were your own and you
paid for it.

If you deplete some consumables, take the responsibility to replenish it so it
is there for future use.

Purchasing
----------

If the lab needs basic office supplies or computer supplies, a request should
be made to the secretary. Don't purchase these yourself, because they should be
purchased through the university vendors.

If you need some lab supplies or equipment for your project, talk with your
supervisor about it and they can order what you need if there are funds
available.

Equipment Inventory
-------------------

When new equipment arrives in the lab, the receiver is responsible for
inventorying the equipment. This only needs to be done for items that cost more
than 250 EUR. The basic steps are:

- Log the equipment in the inventory spreadsheet on the shared Google Drive.
  This should include product name, manufacturer, serial number, manufacturer
  contact info, value, etc. (fill out the existing columns or make new ones if
  needed).
- Make a folder in the Google Drive for the product and deposit any
  documentation.
- If the item doesn't have a storage container, obtain one so that it can
  neatly be stored in the lab and things don't get lost. Leave paper
  documentation in the container.
- Permanently mark the item(s) and container with "TU Delft Bicycle Lab" (use a
  paint pen, inscribing tool, etc.)
- As you learn the device, leave any relevant documentation you obtain or
  create in the Google Drive folder so that future users can learn from your
  work. Include the manufacturer's documents as well as your personal tips and
  explanations on using the equipment. If any documentation is more appropriate
  for storing and tracking with version control, then add that to a lab owned
  Git repository.

Experiments
===========

See the `Experimentation Guide <{filename}/pages/guide-experimentation.rst>`_.

Training
========

It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.

Useful TU Delft MSc Courses
---------------------------

Multibody Dynamics B
   Core high level dynamics principles that are the foundation for almost every
   project in the lab.
Special Topics Course in Sports Engineering
   TU Delft organizes an annual two week course to train students in sports
   engineering. Cycling has been used as the motivating topic to learn the
   methods.
Musculoskeletal Modelling and Simulation (ME41005)
   Learn how to develop and utilized computational neuromuscular models with
   OpenSim. Many projects in the lab make use of neuromuscular and
   biomechanical modeling.
Vehicle Dynamics and Control (RO47017)
   Provides various fundamentals for understanding vehicle motion and how to
   control it. Focused on automobiles but many concepts transfer to single
   track vehicles.
System Identification and Parameter Estimation (ME41065)
   We often make use system identification and parameter estimation for both
   vehicle and human control models.
Automatic Flight Control System Design (AE4301)
   There are many similarities in single track vehicle control and aircraft
   control. This course also covers some topics on aircraft handling qualities
   which we make use of in understanding single track vehicle handling
   qualities.
Writing a Master's Thesis in English (TPM305A)
   If you would like help and motivation on your writing assignments during
   your MSc, this course can be helpful to give structure, guidance, and others
   to discuss your thesis with.

The Carpentries Trainings
-------------------------

Each lab member will need to learn the collaborative software tools and open
source development practices needed to work on code and other text based
sources together. Carpentries trainings (Software Carpentry in particular) is a
great way to get started on this. TU Delft offers regular courses:

- `Software Carpentry Workshops
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshop/>`_

Sign up by emailing Femke van Giessen (F.vanGiessen@tudelft.nl) to register for
a slot. You will be directed to an Evenbrite. Sign up on Eventbrite immediately
because these typically fill up in 10 minutes and there are large wait lists.

- TU Delft Data Champions hosts events and trainings:

Conferences
-----------

PhDs and Postdocs should submit to and present at conferences each year, if
possible. MSc and BSc students are also encouraged to do so if resources allow.

`Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference <http://bmdconf.org/>`_
   This conference is the most closely related to the bicycle lab's core
   research in single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control. The
   conference series ordinated with Arend Schwab and his colleagues and was
   launched in 2010 in Delft. The lab should make a strong effort every three
   years to submit to and be involved in this conference.
`International Cycling Safety Conference <http://cyclingsafety.net/>`_
   This is the next most important conference to be involved in. We should aim
   to have at least one or two submissions to this conference each year.
`ECCOMAS <https://www.eccomas.org/>`_ Multibody Dynamics Conference
   This is a good conference for presenting topics that focus in multibody
   dynamics methods.
`International Sports Engineering Conference <https://www.sportsengineering.org/events/conference/>`_
   This is the best conference to submit sports engineering topics. It is held
   every other year. There are likely many other TU Delft participants,
   especially through the Sports Engineering Institute.
`International Society of Biomechanics Congresses <https://isbweb.org/activities/congresses>`_
   Huge annual conference with a broad array of biomechanics topics. Great
   networking and a catch all for many topics from the lab. Every two years.
   The Technical Group in Computer Simulation holds a parallel symposium.
`SciPy <https://conference.scipy.org/>`_ & `EuroSciPY <https://www.euroscipy.org/>`_
   Annual conferences. If your work involves open source Python software these
   are a great place to showcase the advances in library development and use of
   the tools.
Dutch Bio-Medical Engineering Conference
   Nice way to connect with Dutch local researchers.
`Science & Cycling <https://science-cycling.org>`_
   Annual European conference focused on performance and cycling as a sport.
`Velo-city <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velo-city>`_
   Cycling planning conference for general audience: planners, advocates,
   researchers, industry, etc.
`EUROBIKE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobike>`_
   Annual bicycle tradeshow for Europe.

Journals
========

`Human Power eJournal <https://hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm>`_
   Modern incarnation of the journal Human Power. Not necessarily an academic
   journal, but useful articles none-the-less.
`Human Power: the technical journal of the IHPVA <http://ihpva.org/hparchive.htm>`_
   Started by David Gordon Wilson; ran from 1977 to 2004.

Funding Opportunities
=====================

`Dekker-Padget Internshiup Program: Dutch2USA <https://thenaf.org/dutch2usa-internship-program/>`_
   Funding for minority or economically disadvantaged college students to do an
   internship in the USA.
`Veni <https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme>`_
   The Veni is part of the NWO's Talent Programme. It is the first of three
   personal grants. Postdocs in the lab that plan to continue in academia
   should apply for this. Final year PhDs are also encouraged to apply too. If
   you get this grant, you will gain a strong advantage in moving your academic
   career forward in the Netherlands. If you don't, you'll have practiced
   developing your personal research vision and goals, which is also extremely
   valuable.

Recommended Reading
===================

Your projects will vary and you'll have to read a variety of different papers
and resources, but this list provides a general set of papers that it is good
for all lab members to read.

Introduction to Bicycle Science
-------------------------------

David G. Wilson, Bicycling Science, 3rd ed. MIT Press, 2004.
   Bicycling Science is the authoritative introduction text to the science and
   engineering of bicycles.
Edmund R. Burke, High-Tech Cycling, 2nd ed. Human Kinetics, 2003.
   Science of competitive cycling.

Introduction to Bicycle Dynamics
--------------------------------

|Astrom2005|
   IEEE control systems magazine article that introduces bicycle dynamics with
   a few different models and nice explanation of important control principles.
|Meijaard2007|
   Shows the fundamental bicycle model we typically start with for
   understanding lateral dynamics of single track vehicles. Introduces much of
   the important terminology and principles.
|Sharp2008|
   Robin Sharp developed one of the most widely cited motorcycle dynamics
   models in 1970 (also recommended read), but this paper is his take on
   bicycle dynamics, stability, and control after many years of work on the
   topic of single track vehicle dynamics. It also lays out a number of core
   principles for the study of lateral dynamics of bicycles.
