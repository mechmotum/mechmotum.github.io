This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it to do so. Discuss with the
lab any desires to change any of the guidelines.

Getting Started
===============

- Join the lab communication channels: Ask Jason <j.k.moore@tudelft.nl> to add
  you to the lab `email list`_ and someone in the lab how to join the lab's
  element/matrix chat room or read the instructions in the Google Drive "How to
  join the Element/Matrix chat room".
- Send an introduction email to the lab email list
  (mechmotum@googlegroups.com): who you are, a bit about yourself, what you
  will work on, etc.
- Add your name and portrait to the `lab members page`_ by sending a PNG or JPG
  300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.
- Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
  be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
  recommendations.
- Attend biweekly `lab meetings <#laboratory-meetings>`_. Ask a lab member for
  the calendar invite.
- Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
  needed). These can be requested from Jason by sending him an email with your
  student ID number, TU Delft email address, and expected duration of access.
  Ask for a tour of the space from a current lab member before you start
  working there.
- Request access to the lab's shared Google Drive from Jason.
- Request to be added to the Github lab team organization: https://github.com/mechmotum.
- We have the optional "Cheese for Thought" lunch every Wednesday at 12:00, meet
  at the lab. This is a chance to discuss topics informally or have some good
  weather fun.
- Every month we have a Friday afternoon lab tidying session at 16:30 and we go
  for snacks and drinks (Vrijmibo) in Delft on Fridays @ 17:00.
- See the `recommended reading list <#recommended-reading>`_ below for some
  reading materials to get you started.

BSc Teams
---------

- BSc student teams doing projects with the lab can have lab access. To gain
  access:

  - Send list of students (name, student ID, email) and end date of access to
    the lab coordinator or Jason.
  - Each student who requests access must confirm they have read this guide,
    most importantly the safety and space usage rules.

- One person from each team must join the lab email list and lab chat to send
  and receive lab communication. This person should inform the rest of their
  team on any pertinent information.
- The team may have access to the Google Drive folder, ideally just one person
  per team. Send this request to Jason and include the netid's needing access.
- All members of the team must follow the lab rules in this guide and
  instruction by any of the lab members.
- A team should use a project box for their project if lab storage is needed.
- The MSc, PhD, and Postdoc projects have priority for lab space. Coordinate
  sharing space and time with the lab via your supervisor or via the lab
  chat/email.

Communication
=============

Lab Email List
   When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

   This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
   discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
   for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion. Write to the
   email list by sending a message to mechmotum@googlegroups.com.
Text, Audio, Video Chat Room
   We host a matrix_ server which can be accessed using https://element.io or
   any other supported clients_. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
   We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
   transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
   There are a number of rooms that you can join where we share papers,
   conference announcements, etc.
Issue Trackers
   We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communicate.
   This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
   organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
   repository (in addition to the website issues):

   https://github.com/mechmotum/housekeeping

Blog Posts
   In general, we would like each project to write at least one blog post for
   the lab website. This post should at least describe project results. This
   writing exercise will help build the content for future papers and theses
   and provide outreach to the public about our work. If you write more than
   one blog post, it is helpful to do these on a schedule (quarterly,
   semi-annually, etc.). If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll
   need to select aspects of the project or work that can be shared or embargo
   the blog post to a later date. Discuss these things with your supervisor.

.. _matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _clients: https://github.com/mechmotum

Lab Roles
=========

We collectively keep the lab (both metaphysical and physical) running,
organized, and useful for all. To do so, we designate responsibility for
several task groups to individuals and it is their role to take responsibility
for those tasks.  This does not mean they have to do all tasks in a role, so
they will have to leverage lab members and university resources to help keeping
things running. Lab roles rotate and you should at least do a role for a
quarter. Postdocs and PhDs should take more responsibility than MSc students,
in general. It is important that role activities are public and documented so
the role can be passed on to a new person will minimal disturbance.

We *all* manage the lab tasks on the Github housekeeping issue list (do not put
any personal information there as it is public):

https://github.com/mechmotum/housekeeping/issues

Keep the issues up-to-date so that they can be passed to others.

Laboratory Meetings
===================

We meet every two weeks as a lab, where we will have two designated people
(picked in advance at random in our very own weighted raffle) take the
proverbial stage and share and teach any topic that can be useful in our
academic endeavors.

The topic can be anything bicycle or research related. It may be
content-related, soft-skill related, practical-skill related or harking to your
personal interest in bicycles. It might be an expertise or skill you have, but
also be a skill or software program you want to learn. Co-presenting is fine
(and a great way to meet your peers) provided your topics align. Options
galore:

- <10 minute presentation with Q & A
- tutorial
- have us read something (a paper) we could review (journal club)
- watch and discuss a video
- invite a speaker
- play a game
- practice your colloquia or conference talks
- bicycle-themed stand-up
- etc.

Members are expected to attend and participate regularly. It's fine to miss a
meeting here and there, but avoid making that regular. If the meetings are not
useful to you, please be proactive about helping us make them useful for all.

The MC position rotates approximately every quarter. See the `MC Guide`_ for
instructions on being the MC.

.. _MC Guide: {filename}/pages/guide-mc-lab-meetings.rst

At lab meetings we do a quick round of AIOs. "AIO" stands for Accomplishments,
Issues, and Objectives. Be prepared to give a brief updated on:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

See the `archive of past meetings <{filename}/pages/lab-meetings-archive.rst>`_
for prior topics and examples.

Research Ideas
==============

Specific MSc project advertisements can be found on the `jobs
<{filename}/pages/jobs.rst>`_.

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

Have a look at current and past projects on the `research page
<{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_

Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice from the lab should be open
practices (open access publications, open source software, open data,
accessible and public sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information
public ask you supervisor, otherwise please default to sharing early and often.
We do work with organizations that value or require privacy (human subject
data, student protected data, proprietary company needs). Always check with the
involved parties before sharing when this is the case. This is something that
should be discussed at the beginning of all projects.

TU Delft offers several resources for open science:

- `TU Delft Library Open Science <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/>`_
- `Open Access Publishing Information <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing/>`_
- `TU Delft 2020-2024 Open Science Strategic Plan <https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f2faff07-408f-4cec-bd87-0919c9e4c26f>`_
- `You Share, We Take Care! <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care/>`_

Research Tools Contributions
----------------------------

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.

.. _Pelican: getpelican.com

Software Tools
==============

Shared Cloud Space
------------------

We have a directory named "Fietslab Commons" on Google Drive. To access this,
request that it be shared with you by your supervisor. This folder and it's
contents should only be shared with other ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` addresses
that are members of the lab. ``<netid>@g-tudelft.nl`` is also the login
username/email that you will need to use when logging into
https://drive.google.com. Avoid using the "Share" button to share with
non-TUD accounts, until we determine best practices for this. Read and update
the README files present in the Google Drive directories to learn how to use
the space. If you create new directories, add a README file to explain what the
purpose of the folder is. If you want to add large amounts of data (>10 Gb),
inform your supervisor first because there may be a more appropriate long term
storage solution for certain types of data.

Reference Management
--------------------

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 2 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference management
system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and request
membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can view the
contents of this library.

.. _Zotero: https://www.zotero.org
.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
---------------

The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum
- https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/bicyclelab

The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

**Private repositories** are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.

.. _Git lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

Our Software
------------

This presentation gives a basic overview over the set of software packages
we've developed:

   frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"
   mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

Lab Space
=========

Tidiness
--------

- The lab should be kept clean and tidy.
- Place small trash into the two bins and paper into the blue box for pickup by
  the janitors.
- Place large trash, paper, cardboard outside in the bins near the bike cage.
  Do not leave this lying in the floor of the bike lab. It will not be picked
  up.
- Always leave the lab cleaner and tidier than you found it. If followed, this
  will tend towards a clean and tidy lab instead of the opposite.
- Always clean up before the end of a work day (reserve last 15 minutes to do
  so).
- Put items and tools back in their labeled locations. If there isn't a label
  or location, make one.

Safety
------

Our goal is to have ZERO injuries in the lab. Safety should be taken seriously
and always prioritized. Some key things:

- Wear safety glasses and other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
  when using tools. These are available in the lab or can be borrowed from the
  workshop. Contact your supervisor if we need more PPE.
- Do not use tools that you are not familiar with. Always ask someone to show
  you proper use.
- Any activities that have potential to cause injury performed outside of the
  8:00-17:00 weekday (non-holiday) times should always have two people present.
  During the workday period it is recommended to have a buddy present when
  doing anything can cause injury, but the number of people in the halls and
  glass walls make this optional.
- The large treadmill **always** has to have two people for operation. When the
  treadmill is operating the walker/rider must be wearing the harness properly
  and the operator must have their hand on the kill switch. Ensure that objects
  cannot fly off the back of the treadmill.
- Human subject experiments must have an HREC plan and protocol (always for
  PhD, Postdoc and at minimum approval from your supervisors for MSc).
- If you are ever asking yourself "should I do this?", that's probably a good
  signal that you shouldn't. Get help, advice, training, etc. so that you do
  your activity safely.

Equipment & Consumables
-----------------------

If you find something in the lab you would like to use, post a note to the
Element/matrix chat or lab email asking if anyone else is using it or plans to
use it. If no one is using it, then you can!

If a TU Delft staff or student that is not a lab member would like to borrow
equipment from the lab for TU Delft research, find out if anyone is using it
(as noted above), and then make sure they fill out the checkout sheet (by the
lab door) with their name, email, date, and your name (as the responsible
person) before the item leaves the lab. When they return the item, indicate the
return date on the sheet. Keep in mind that non-lab member students and staff
should look to the more general shared equipment resources available in ME
before borrowing from us. Do not loan common things like screwdrivers and
general tools, as those can be borrowed from the faculty machine shops. In
general, do not loan our bike tools out, researchers that need them can come to
the bike lab and use them. Do not loan tools or equipment for people's personal
use.

If you take things from the lab to use elsewhere for **more than one day** you
also need to sign the equipment checkout sheet. Note your name and the date you
took the item. Once the item is returned to the lab, note the date returned.

If you damage or lose equipment you are responsible for fixing or finding a
replacement. Please let your supervisor know if this occurs so you all can
figure out a solution. Your caution and carefulness should be proportionate to
the cost of the lab equipment. Treat things as if they were your own and you
paid for it.

If you deplete some consumables, take the responsibility to replenish it so it
is there for future use.

Purchasing
----------

If the lab needs basic office supplies or computer supplies, a request should
be made to the secretary. Don't purchase these yourself, because they should be
purchased through the university vendors.

If you need some lab supplies or equipment for your project, talk with your
supervisor about it and they can order what you need if there are funds
available.

Equipment Inventory
-------------------

When new equipment arrives in the lab, the receiver is responsible for
inventorying the equipment. This only needs to be done for items that cost more
than 250 EUR. The basic steps are:

- Log the equipment in the inventory spreadsheet on the shared Google Drive.
  This should include product name, manufacturer, serial number, manufacturer
  contact info, value, etc. (fill out the existing columns or make new ones if
  needed).
- Make a folder in the Google Drive for the product and deposit any
  documentation.
- If the item doesn't have a storage container, obtain one so that it can
  neatly be stored in the lab and things don't get lost. Leave paper
  documentation in the container.
- Permanently mark the item(s) and container with "TU Delft Bicycle Lab" (use a
  paint pen, inscribing tool, etc.)
- As you learn the device, leave any relevant documentation you obtain or
  create in the Google Drive folder so that future users can learn from your
  work. Include the manufacturer's documents as well as your personal tips and
  explanations on using the equipment. If any documentation is more appropriate
  for storing and tracking with version control, then add that to a lab owned
  Git repository.

Waste
-----

- Put paper waste in the blue plastic bin by the door.
- Put small trash in the small trash cans in the lab.
- Metals can be recycled by putting them in the bins in the student workshop or
  the bins in the basement.
- Take larger trash and paper outside to the large bins in the rear of the ME
  building.
- Put old small batteries in the bin in the hallway in the F wing.
- Contact the servicepunt to dispose of any large batteries and people will
  come to collect it.

ME Vehicle Testing Area
-----------------------

The fenced off parking lot behind the ME building can be booked if you need an
open space for bicycle experiments. To do so, book the room "Room-TESTAREA-ME
(outdoor test area ME)" in the TU Delft Outlook calendar system.

Training
========

It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.

Useful TU Delft MSc Courses
---------------------------

Multibody Dynamics B
   Core high level dynamics principles that are the foundation for almost every
   project in the lab.
Special Topics Course in Sports Engineering
   TU Delft organizes an annual two week course to train students in sports
   engineering. Cycling has been used as the motivating topic to learn the
   methods.
Musculoskeletal Modelling and Simulation (ME41005)

   If you would like help and motivation on your writing assignments during
   your MSc, this course can be helpful to give structure, guidance, and others
   to discuss your thesis with.

The Carpentries Trainings
-------------------------

Each lab member will need to learn the collaborative software tools and open
source development practices needed to work on code and other text based
sources together. Carpentries trainings (Software Carpentry in particular) is a
great way to get started on this. TU Delft offers regular courses:

- `Software Carpentry Workshops

Conferences
-----------

PhDs and Postdocs should submit to and present at conferences each year, if
possible. MSc and BSc students are also encouraged to do so if resources allow.

`Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference <http://bmdconf.org/>`_
   This conference is the most closely related to the bicycle lab's core
   research in single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control. The
   conference series ordinated with Arend Schwab and his colleagues and was
   launched in 2010 in Delft. The lab should make a strong effort every three
   years to submit to and be involved in this conference.
`International Cycling Safety Conference <http://cyclingsafety.net/>`_
   This is the next most important conference to be involved in. We should aim
   to have at least one or two submissions to this conference each year.
`ECCOMAS <https://www.eccomas.org/>`_ Multibody Dynamics Conference
   This is a good conference for presenting topics that focus in multibody
   dynamics methods.
`International Sports Engineering Conference <https://www.sportsengineering.org/events/conference/>`_
   This is the best conference to submit sports engineering topics. It is held
   every other year. There are likely many other TU Delft participants,
   especially through the Sports Engineering Institute.
`International Society of Biomechanics Congresses <https://isbweb.org/activities/congresses>`_
   Huge annual conference with a broad array of biomechanics topics. Great
   networking and a catch all for many topics from the lab. Every two years.
   The Technical Group in Computer Simulation holds a parallel symposium.
`SciPy <https://conference.scipy.org/>`_ & `EuroSciPY <https://www.euroscipy.org/>`_
   Annual conferences. If your work involves open source Python software these
   are a great place to showcase the advances in library development and use of
   the tools.
Dutch Bio-Medical Engineering Conference
   Nice way to connect with Dutch local researchers.
`Science & Cycling <https://science-cycling.org>`_
   Annual European conference focused on performance and cycling as a sport.

`Dekker-Padget Internshiup Program: Dutch2USA <https://thenaf.org/dutch2usa-internship-program/>`_
   Funding for minority or economically disadvantaged college students to do an
   internship in the USA.
`Veni <https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme>`_
   The Veni is part of the NWO's Talent Programme. It is the first of three
   personal grants. Postdocs in the lab that plan to continue in academia
   should apply for this. Final year PhDs are also encouraged to apply too. If
   you get this grant, you will gain a strong advantage in moving your academic
   career forward in the Netherlands. If you don't, you'll have practiced
   developing your personal research vision and goals, which is also extremely
   valuable.

Recommended Reading
===================

Your projects will vary and you'll have to read a variety of different papers
and resources, but this list provides a general set of papers that it is good
for all lab members to read.

Introduction to Bicycle Science
-------------------------------

David G. Wilson, Bicycling Science, 3rd ed. MIT Press, 2004.
   Bicycling Science is the authoritative introduction text to the science and
   engineering of bicycles.
Edmund R. Burke, High-Tech Cycling, 2nd ed. Human Kinetics, 2003.
   Science of competitive cycling.

Introduction to Bicycle Dynamics
--------------------------------

|Astrom2005|
   IEEE control systems magazine article that introduces bicycle dynamics with
   a few different models and nice explanation of important control principles.
|Meijaard2007|
   Shows the fundamental bicycle model we typically start with for
   understanding lateral dynamics of single track vehicles. Introduces much of
   the important terminology and principles.
|Sharp2008|
   Robin Sharp developed one of the most widely cited motorcycle dynamics
   models in 1970 (also recommended read), but this paper is his take on
   bicycle dynamics, stability, and control after many years of work on the
   topic of single track vehicle dynamics. It also lays out a number of core
   principles for the study of lateral dynamics of bicycles.
Ciechanowski2023_
   Really impressive interactive explanation of bicycle dynamics by Bartosz
   Ciechanowski that both gets the dynamics right and makes it beautiful (in
   `Bret Victor`_ style).
