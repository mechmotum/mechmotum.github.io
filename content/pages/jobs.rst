PhD & Postdoctoral Researchers
==============================

If you are interested in doing paid research with the lab [#]_ there are two
options:

1. Wait for an open position in the lab and apply.
2. Find self-funding and ask if we can host and work with you.

All paid positions associated with the lab will be posted to the `TU Delft
vacancies website`_, the `BioMechanical Engineering Department vacancies web
page`_, `Academic Transfer`_ [#]_, and/or `this lab website
</category/jobs.html>`_.

.. _Academic Transfer: http://www.academictransfer.com
.. _TU Delft vacancies website: https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/
.. _BioMechanical Engineering Department vacancies web page: https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/about-bmeche/vacancies/

.. [#] PhD positions at TU Delft are considered full time academic research
   jobs and we only accept you if there is an available paid position. You are
   also required to have a Master's degree to start a PhD.
.. [#] All academic jobs in the Netherlands are (and have to be) posted to
   Academic Transfer.

Master's Students
=================

Anyone may apply to the Master's Program at TU Delft if you have completed an
appropriate Bachelor's degree. If you want to work directly in this lab it is
best to apply to the `Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering`_ and
preferably select the `BioMechanical Design Track`_. `This video`_ explains the
MSc tracks in the BME department.

If you would like to work on a project for your Master's thesis in the lab
please send a letter explaining your interest in the lab and/or project, CV or
resume, a list of courses you've taken, the name of your MSc track, and any
other relevant information to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl. Include whether you are a
current student, have been accepted to the University, or have not applied yet.

The `current and past research projects <{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_
will also give some ideas of what is possible. I will provide any confidential
projects available in personal communication with you. If any of these projects
interest you or you have a project idea that is similar, be sure to let me know
in your introduction email.

.. [#] We also post and formulate more raw project ideas here: https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues.

Bachelor's Students
===================

Students working towards their Bachelor's degree are welcome to join the lab to
get research and engineering experience. The best way to work with us it to
choose a Bachelor's final project proposed from the lab in your final year.
Otherwise, please send a letter explaining your interest in the lab, CV or
resume, and any other relevant information to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl.
