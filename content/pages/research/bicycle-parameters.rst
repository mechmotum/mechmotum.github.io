:summary-sentence: The purpose of this research is to establish methods for
                   measuring and estimating the physical parameters of bicycles
                   and bicycle riders necessary for simulating models of the
                   bicycle-rider system.

In [Moore2008]_ we developed and used a method for estimating the inertial
properties of the bicycle and rider given simple geometric measurements. The
rider method in [Moore2008]_ was formalized in [Moore2009]_ and combined with
more accurate measures and estimates of the bicycle's physical parameters based
on the methods used in [Kooijman2006]_. We presented estimates of the physical
parameters of several different styles of bicycles in [Moore2010]_ and compared
their resulting dynamics. Then in [Moore2012]_ the prior work was further
refined and included measurements of additional bicycles and a new method for
estimating the rider's inertial parameters. The generalized human inertia
estimation method used in [Moore2012]_ was published in [Dembia2015]_.  The
software [Moore2011]_ used for the computations has been developed over the
years and basic functionality is now available in a freely accessible web
application:
