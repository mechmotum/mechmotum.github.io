Description
===========

**Motivations**

Riding a bicycle — especially in a busy city — requires constant attention and
effort. This study focuses on a specific situation: when a cyclist rides with
their hands off the handlebars. This makes balancing harder and increases
mental load. The goal is to find out whether we can detect this extra effort
using simple measurements — like how the eyes move or how the bike wobbles.

**Data collection**

The experiment used a regular electric bike equipped with sensors to track its
movement. The rider wore special glasses that record where they look —
including how often they blink, fix their gaze, or shift their eyes quickly.
Two situations were tested: riding normally (hands on the handlebars) and
riding with hands off. The rider kept a steady speed and went straight ahead in
both cases.

**Analysis**

Researchers compared how the bike moved and how the rider’s eyes behaved in
both situations. The idea was to see if changes in eye behavior — like how long
they look at one spot or how big their pupils get — match up with the extra
effort needed to balance without hands.

**Main results**

When riding with hands off, the bike wobbled more — which makes sense, since
it’s harder to stay upright. At the same time, the rider’s eyes showed signs of
higher mental load: they looked longer at fixed points, and their pupils got
slightly larger. These changes suggest that eye tracking could be a useful way
to estimate how hard a cyclist is working — even without asking them directly.

In short, simple eye and bike measurements may help us understand what’s going
on in a cyclist’s mind while they ride — especially when they’re trying to
balance without using their hands.
