:summary-sentence: This project's goal is to connect the subjective cognitive workload of 
                   cyclists with gaze, head kinematics and vehicule kinematics metrics. 
                   This reseach investigate the possibiliy to predict the subjective workload based
                   on objective metrics using machine learning methods.
