:summary-sentence: Little safety driven engineering goes into the design and
                   construction of ski and snowboard jumps in terrain parks at
                   publicly accessible ski resorts. Catastrophic injuries and
                   even deaths occur during skiing and snowboarding at these
                   resorts. It is possible to design the landing surfaces of
                   jumps such that the normal impact velocity on landing is
                   capped at a safer value regardless of the jumper's takeoff
                   speed and jump launch speed. These jump designs can still
                   provide large maximum heights and flight durations for
                   participant fun. We have designed a web application that
                   laypeople can use to design and analyze ski jumps with
                   specified equivalent fall height in mind.
