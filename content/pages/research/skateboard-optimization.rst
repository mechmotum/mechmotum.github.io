:summary-sentence: Skateboarders can perform complex tricks and maneuvers.
                   Firstly, we are interested in figuring out how the skaters'
                   manipulate and control the board and their body using
                   optimal control methods. Secondly, we want to design the
                   board and environment to maximize performance and safety.
