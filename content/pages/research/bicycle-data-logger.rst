:summary-sentence: Analysis of comprehensive dynamical data during bicycling
                   trips and activities has the potential to teach us much
                   about travel behavior and safety of bicyclists. We would
                   like to develop a open collaborative project with the aim of
                   creating a modular, continually inexpensive, open source,
                   and open hardware bicycle data logger.

This idea was pitched by Marco Dozza at ICSC 2017 [#]_ and we are working with
his team to bring this to fruition.
