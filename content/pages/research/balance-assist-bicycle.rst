:summary-sentence: We have developed a bicycle with a electric steering motor
                   that is capable of stabilizing itself at lower speeds than
                   regular bicycles. When ridden this effect enhances the
                   rider's balance at low speeds where falls often occur.

Description
===========

A substantial number of falls while bicycling happen due to loss of balance and
control at low speeds [1]_. A normal bicycle is unstable at low speeds and
requires acute attention from the rider to maintain balance. We have developed
a bicycle with a steering motor that can steer itself and can stabilize itself
at speeds as low as 6 km/h. When ridden, the steer motor assists the rider in
balancing and staying upright. We are evaluating whether this bicycle can
reduce the chances of falling in hazardous situations. Our first study shows
that riders use less steering and have less rolling motions when the steering
motor control is activated [2]_.

Below are videos that demonstrate the bicycle's ability to stabilize itself:
