Description
===========

We have proposed a theoretical lateral handling quality metric for any given
bicycle design based on a corpus of experimental data in aircraft handling
research [#]_. This project aims to validate this metric directly from
experimental evidence in bicycling maneuvers and tasks. We have developed a
variable stability instrumented bicycle and demonstrated preliminarily that
that there may be correlations between our theoretical metric and the rider's
subjective opinion of the bicycle's handling [#]_. Ongoing work includes,
improvements to the experimental apparatus and protocol for a larger scale
validation with arbitrary experimental subjects [#]_.
