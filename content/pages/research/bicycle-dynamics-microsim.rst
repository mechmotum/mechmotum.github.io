Description
===========

Simulated safety assessment is a valuable prospective tool to understand the impact of 
new traffic infrastructure and novel innovations in the traffic sector 
like automated vehicles, cycling assistance systems, and intelligent connectivity. 
However, current traffic simulations are designed to model traffic flow and do 
not automatically enable reliable safety assessment, especially for cyclists. 

In this project, we investigate the influence of bicycle dynamics on the traffic 
conflict process. This aims to improve simulation models towards better representing
cyclist behavior and to add one potentially crucial factor on the way to capturing
conflict causality in simulation. Understanding the role of vehicle dynamics in 
conflicts may also contribute to developing safer vehicles, safer infrastructure, and
future assistance systems. 

For our analysis, we add explicit mechanical models of bicycle dynamics to existing 
traffic simulation frameworks. We collect data on cyclist conflict behavior in
controlled experimental conditions and natural traffic, calibrate the improved 
models to the observations, and evaluate the model performance in comparison to existing 
models without bicycle dynamics.

At the heart of our project lies the development of an interaction model for cyclists.  
We adapted the social force concept introduced by Helbing and Molnár [1]_ to accommodate 
models of bicycle dynamics and rider control. Our first conference paper from this 
project details the approach [2]_. It enables us to test different 
bicycle dynamic models with varying controllers in simulated conflict scenarios. The model 
is compatible with DLR's established open-source traffic simulation SUMO_ [3].

Ongoing Work
============

- **Rider control parameters for desired yaw inputs:**  Extracting the rider control parameters 
  from responses to desired yaw angle input collected in controlled riding experiments to calibrate 
  the bicycle dynamics.

- **Cyclist interaction behavior (Master's Graduation Project Anna Marbus):** Conducting a controlled 
  riding experiment and recording highly accurate dynamic data from on-bike sensors to understand the 
  behavior of cyclists in different traffic conflict scenarios. 

- **Native Cyclist Social Forces for SUMO:** Adding a new C++ implementation of our cyclist 
  social force model to the codebase of DLR's open-source simulator SUMO_ to make the model 
  generally available for use in traffic simulation.
