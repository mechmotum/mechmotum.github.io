:summary-sentence: Steering a bicycle, or similar single track vehicles, is a
                   complex motor control task. Human riders, in general, are
                   able to balance and control a bicycle but there are
                   scenarios where the rider fails to control the vehicle in a
                   desired way. This line of research is focused on the
                   possible improvements to balance and control of a bicycle by
                   providing robotic steer control augmentation.

Steering is the primary and most effective control input for balancing and
directing a bicycle along the desired path. It is possible to introduce
acutators that manipulate the steering in conjunction with the rider. The
acuators' behavior can be driven by sensor measurements. We are interested in
augmenting the rider's steering behavior when the rider's own actions are
deficient for the event at hand. For example, if the rider steers the bicycle
such that it looses traction and the rider will likely fall an acutator can
take over an attempt to prevent the fall. Motor control placed into or
alongside the human-vehicle control loop can also alter the dynamics of the
vehicle to make it easier to control. This is standard practive in aircraft.
