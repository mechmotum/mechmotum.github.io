:summary-sentence: Steering a bicycle, or similar single track vehicles, is a
                   complex motor control task. Human riders, in general, are
                   able to balance and control a bicycle but there are
                   scenarios where the rider fails to control the vehicle in a
                   desired way. This line of research is focused on the
                   possible improvements to balance and control of a bicycle by
                   providing robotic steer control augmentation.

Steering is the primary and most effective control input for balancing and
directing a bicycle along the desired path. It is possible to introduce
acutators that manipulate the steering.
