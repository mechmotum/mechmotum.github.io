Common Issues
=============

Conciseness
-----------

Conciseness typically equates to clarity. Edit things down, keep removing until
only the essential information is present.

When to use a figure
--------------------

If you refer to a figure in the text, that figure should be nearby the text so
that the reader can read your interpretation of the figure while looking at it.

All figures should be referenced and discussed in the text, i.e. don't just
throw in a figure because you made and it looks nice.

Only insert a figure when it enhances the story you are telling in the text.

Figure and Table Captions
-------------------------

Figures and tables and their associated captions should be able to be removed
from the text and a reader should still be able to "read" the figure or table.
This means that the caption should help the reader know how to read the figure.
Anything that isn't obvious from the figure's design should be include, e.g.
"The solid black lines represent the real part of the eigenvalue loci for the
fifth eigenmode." The caption should not include discussion or interpretation
of the figure, that belongs in your primary text.

Creating figures
----------------

Students often create figures that are saved from figure creation software
without any adjustments to the default settings. The default settings are never
appropriate. Search the internet for how to make publication quality figures
with your preferred software. For example here are some

Python

- https://atchen.me/research/code/data-viz/2022/01/04/plotting-matplotlib-reference.html
- https://github.com/jbmouret/matplotlib_for_papers

Matlab

- https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47921-plotpub-publication-quality-graphs-in-matlab

Common issues:

- The figure is poorly scaled for actual paper sizes.
- Bitmap images have either too high or too low resolution. Make your
  resolutions 300 dpi (dot per inch).
- Font sizes are too small on axis labels and legends, for example.
- Grey backgrounds are left in the figure (common for Matlab).
- Readers cannot discern individual lines or dots in the plot. For example, you
  may have a time series line plot of an accelerometer over 30 minutes. Showing
  all 30 minutes is simply a blob of color that is not useful. Show only 1
  minute or 30 seconds so that the reader can see the data in a useful context.

Figure Copyright
----------------

In general, you cannot include figures you did not create draw yourself in your
document. If you want to include the figure there are essentially three
options:

1. Ask the copyright holder for written permission to use their figure.
2. If the copyright holder has licensed their figure with a Creative Commons
   license (or similar) then you can use the figure if you abide by the
   license's rules. This usually means displaying the reference to the license
   and the authors.
3. It may be possible to use the figure without permission if the use falls
   under an exception in your jurisdiction. Dutch Law seems to have exceptions
   for "Illustration for teaching or scientific research", "Quotation for
   criticism or review", and "Use for the purpose of research or private
   study". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_Netherlands

Math
----

Take time to typeset your math equations and number each equation for
referencing in the text. Follow mathematical notation standards to make it easy
for the readers.

Do not use :math:`a*b` or :math:`a\times b` to indicate scalar multiplication,
:math:`ab` is clear and more than sufficient.

LaTeX
-----

This is how you do quotes in LaTeX!

.. code-block:: latex

   `single quoted stuff'
   ``double quoted stuff''

Backticks on the left quotes are necessary to obtain correctly formatted
quotation marks.

Code
----

There is no reason to include long scripts and programs in your thesis. If a
product of your thesis project is code, it is best to archive your code in the
proper file formats to something like Zenodo or Figshare and then cite in your
thesis. You can also upload an archive of the code to the TU Delft thesis
repository. It is appropriate to include code if you want the reader to read
it. For example you may demonstrate an algorithm by showing a short snippet of
code.

Appendices
----------

Appendices are not just a clearing house to dump all the extra figures and
tables you generated. Appendices are ancillary chapters and sections of your
work. They provide supporting, but not necessary, information for the story in
your main chapters. For example, if you say in a main chapter "We measured the
stiffness of 10 bicycle tires and use those values in the model, see Appendix
A." then appendix A should be a new section with written content that explains
this measurement procedure and the results. If it was in the main text it would
distract the reader from your main points, e.g. model description, but if the
reader questions your stiffness values they can then read the appendix to see
how you arrived at the values.

Referencing commercial equipment
--------------------------------

I applied a 6 hz Butterworth low pass filter to the signal using the
``butter()`` function available in Matlab 2019a (Natick, USA).

File size
---------

There is little reason for the PDF of a thesis to be larger than 10 Mb. If your
document is larger than 10 Mb then you have most likely embedded images that
are much too large. Reduce the size of images before embedding. A 300 dpi image
that fits on an A4 page should only be a few hundred kilobytes.

Style
=====

There are many writing styles; some styles fit with the norms in scientific
writing and some do not. It is extremely important to make your academic
reports and papers as easy to understand as possible. Some style choices will
help you write more clearly.

Here are some recommendations:

- Write in active voice unless the context really needs passive voice to make
  things clearer.
- Write in present tense unless necessary to write in other tenses.

Allen Downey has some nice style notes: https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/style-guide

Active Voice vs Passive Voice
-----------------------------

You should write in active voice as your primary mode. Writing in active voice
is generally simpler and clearer. Use passive voice sparingly. There should be
a specific reason to use passive voice. Most major journals' style guides now
request active voice. The Wikipedia article "`English passive voice`_"  is a
good starting point to learn about the differences in active and passive and
style recommendations. Allen Downey also has a couple quick reads that may help
convince you of the merit of using active voice in scientific writing:

Initialisms and Acronyms
------------------------

Don't use them. For every acronym or initialism you invent, it causes the
reader to have to jump back to your definition every time they see it. The more
you invent the more painful this is. There are two cases where it may be ok to
use them: 1) the initialism or acronym is very commonly known to the expected
audience, e.g.  "PID" is an initialism that any control engineer would know, 2)
you invent a single initialism or acronym for your paper due to repeating the
phrase a *very* large number of times. Never use initialisms or acronyms in
titles or abstracts.  Always define any initialism or acronym (that your or
others invented) on the first use of the phrase. If your sentences have more
than one or two acronyms or initialisms present, you should likely write the
phrases out to ease reading. Initialisms and acronyms make it easier for the
writer but not the reader.
