   Lane change simulation created with BRiM showing without and without a
   rider.

We have developed muscle driven bicycle-rider models and solved basic
trajectory optimization tracking problems, demonstrating that the models and
tools work and are capable. You can see various results here in this `blog post
<{filename}/czi-sympy-wrapup.rst>`_.

This MSc project would be focused on solving some real problems with the new
tools. Here are some examples:

- What are the optimal strategies in balancing a bicycle if you ride no-hands
  versus steering only versus steering body movements? We also know you use
  lateral motion of your knees and that could be interesting to investigate.
- Use the tools to discover the closed loop control the human uses in the
  balancing task.
- Find the optimal race performance over an entire race course using the 3D
  model. You can investigate the effects of changing out different aspects of
  the bicycle: aerodynamics, rolling resistance, etc.?
- Find the effects of energy lost due to lateral motions of tires over the
  whole course.

There are numerous possibilities. You will be writing Python programs and
working on the related tools.
