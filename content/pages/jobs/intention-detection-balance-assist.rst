Description
===========

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab, Bosch eBike Systems, and Gazelle developed the
`Balance Assist Bicycle
<{filename}/pages/research/balance-assist-bicycle.rst>`_. We have demonstrated
that it reduces undesired motion in response to perturbations and reduces the
probability of falling when perturbed at the handlebars, yet many riders have
indicated they do not like the haptic feeling of the steering. The bicycle
stabilizes itself, but this stabilization may be best deactivated when the
rider turns or the haptic forces felt by the rider should be tuned to match the
feeling of a bicycle riders are comfortable with. This thesis project would
develop a method of improving the feel of the balance assist system without
degrading its safety enhancement. Possible methods are developing rider
intention detection or applying model-matching control. This method would be
tested on human subjects to gage their subjective feeling of the handling of
the vehicle in typical bicycle maneuvers.
