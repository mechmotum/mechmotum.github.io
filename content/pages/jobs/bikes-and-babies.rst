We have guidelines on what kind of car seats to use for kids at a given
height/weight/age, but there is nothing like that for bike seats. You will use
available injury data and engineering analysis to make create guidelines on
what kind of bike and/or seat to use at a given height/weight/age for kids
ranging from birth through age ~8. There are many types of bike seats and
configurations: in front of the adult mounted on the top tube, behind the adult
on a rear rack, cargo bikes with kids on the back or front, bike trailers,
ride-behind attachments, and more to consider.

This internship is tied to an exchange program between the University of
Pennsylvania in the USA and TU Delft in the The Netherlands. A group of
students from the University of Pennsylvania will visit TU Delft in the Spring
of 2024 and an intern from TU Delft will work in Pennsylvania before the Spring
of 2024. The program is led by Prof. Dustyn Roberts in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at Penn. Copy
dustyn@seas.upenn.edu on you application. There is no provided funding for the
internship travel, housing, or stipend but you can seek funding for abroad
opportunities at TU Delft or via the `Netherlands-America Foundation
