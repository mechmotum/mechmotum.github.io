Internship
==========

Set up the BMX high torque analysis data acquisition system and collect pilot
data from amateur BMX cyclists. Characterize the data quality for torque,
power, speed, GPS, etc.

Thesis Project
==============

Using the device developed in the internship you develop experiments to will
monitor pedal performance over a period of time and characterize rider
performance through motion and physiological measures with particular focus
on gate exit performance and strategy. Data generation (very precise) of
physical output, both power and breath gas analysis, to be able to see
metabolic impact of gates and full laps, data can be stored in device, no need
to transfer in real time. The feedback system should be capable of assisting
coaches during gate starting training in providing feedback to the athletes.
You will develop metrics for post activity evaluation of BMX performance that
is useful for coaches.

Collaboration
=============

This project is in cooperation with coach Peter Visser and the The Wheely's
Club and Insanity Racing Team.
