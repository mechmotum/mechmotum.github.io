We have recently demonstrated that it is possible ride a bicycle on a treadmill
while wearing a virtual reality headset. We do this by creating a virtual twin
of the bicycle and treadmill that mirrors the physical interactions you have
with both. The purpose of this MSc project would be to discover the
possibilities and limitations of using such a system. We are interested in a
number of things, for example:

- What are the minimal twin elements needed to safely cycle?
- How long does it take people to get accustomed to this experience?
- Is motion sickness prevalent in this environment, if so what experiences
  should we avoid to minimize motion sickness?
- What are the possibilities and limitations in managing deviations from a
  straight path? The cyclist must stay nominally straight on the treadmill but
  there are likely ways to simulate turning to some degree.
- What types of real world cycling scenarios can we mimic in the VR
  environment?

This MSc project will require working with Unity and programming in C#. You
will work with motion capture systems and virtual reality. You'll need also
work with human subjects in the experimentation.
