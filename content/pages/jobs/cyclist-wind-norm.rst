Description
===========

There currently exist a Dutch norm for comfort and safety of pedestrians in
urban areas. Each building that is constructed in a city is analyzed with
computational fluid dynamics simulations and KNMI wind data to determine the
wind direction and magnitudes in the surrounding urban spaces. If the wind
speed exceeds the comfort or safety thresholds the building location and or
design is modified to lower the wind speed in the areas. This internship would
help create thresholds for bicyclists in urban areas. The general approach
would be to apply wind force magnitudes and directions to the bicycle-rider
balance and control models developed by the Bicycle Lab to determine what wind
magnitude force and direction cause departure from a bicycle lane or cause
falls. The results of the internship will be included in the next norm on wind
force limits in urban environments.
