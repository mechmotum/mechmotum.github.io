Skateboarders learn complex tricks and aerial maneuvers through primary
observation in conjunction with trial and error. Learning any new trick entails
danger, as the likelihood of a fall is higher during the learning process
because the correct muscle memory has not been established. There a number of
articles that expound on the public health issues around injuries in
skateboarding, see [Shuman2015]_ for an example. There is a need, especially
for beginners, for training and practicing methods and/or designed equipments
and terrain that can accelerate learning the fundamental tricks while
simultaneously reducing the falls incurred in the process. Our partner, the `US
Skateboard Education Association`_, is interested studying several of the
fundamental tricks that beginners focus on: developing a good stance, the
ollie, dropping in to a ramp, pumping on different common ramps, ramp coping
grinds, etc. The purpose of this project is to develop techniques and assistive
terrain and equipment to accelerate learning and increase safety for beginners
learning fundamental skateboarding tricks. The researcher will use their
knowledge of biomechanics to study novice and expert performance of the tricks,
develop experimental or model backed learning procedures, and use the dynamics
of the tricks to discover optimal terrain and skateboard designs (materials and
geometry) to progressively learn the tricks. The project is fairly open ended
in terms of what fundi tel tricks to focus on and the methods to arrive at the
results.
