MSc General
-----------

- We expect you to take the lead in your project. Your supervisors are here to
  advise and guide you, but it is up to you to manage your time, relationships,
  work, etc.
- BME and BMD MSc students now have some new excellent guidance documents with
  flowcharts available on the "Master Biomedical Engineering" and "Master
  Biomechanical Design" Brightspace courses under "Flowcharts & Guidance Docs".
  Please read these and reference them regularly. The guide here is a
  compliment to those documents.
- You are encouraged to join the "Graduation Community Program" for get-
  togethers and workshops on topics to help you move through your MSc. This is
  especially helpful if you are struggling in your MSc.
- You have to write at least three documents for your MSc. Read the `writing
  guide <{filename}/pages/guide-writing.rst>`_ for tips and expectations.
- Review the `Data Management Guide
  <{filename}/pages/guide-data-management.rst>`_ to learn how to handle your
  data.
- If you are doing experiments, review the `Experimentation Guide
  <{filename}/pages/guide-experimentation.rst>`_.

Internship
----------

15 ECs (420 hours, ~10 weeks full time)

After you have found an internship, typically on your own but sometimes through
postings via the lab, here are some things you need to do:

- Review the Study Guide explanation of your internship, for example:

  - BMD: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59456
  - BME: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59534

- Review the internship forms and guidelines (always use up-to-date forms):
  https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/3me-student-portal/education/related/student-forms/internship-forms
- Fill out the MSc internship initiation form with your project description and
  other relevant information. Develop this project idea with your internship
  company/org contacts. If you think this aligns with Jason's research
  interests or the internship came through the bike lab you can send the form
  to Jason and ask him to be your TUD advisor. If he agrees, then you can
  obtain his signature on the form and forward it to your respective MSc
  coordinator.
- Make all of your internship arrangements yourself with the company (travel,
  stipend, housing, IP, NDA, etc.). Reach out to your TUD supervisor if you
  need help in any of these aspects.
- To receive academic credit for your internship at the end you need to write a
  report and have it assessed by your TUD internship supervisor. The short
  report should contain aspects aligned with those described in this rubric:
  https://wbmt2.tudelft.nl/organisatie/formulieren/msc/3me-msc-assessmentcriteria__internshipreport.pdf
  and the direction and needs of your external internship supervisor. This
  rubric will not be used to determine your grade, it is simply pass/fail based
  on the supervisor's review.
- You also need your external internship supervisor to fill out the form
  "INTERNSHIP ASSESSMENT FORM FOR EXTERNAL PARTIES" and submit the completed
  version to your TUD supervisor.
- Note that your TUD supervisor is typically not involved in your internship
  other than the signing the initial form and assessing and providing a grade
  at the end. The purpose of the internship is for you to get some non-academic
  experience in engineering. The internship should also be distinct from your
  MSc literature study and thesis project in the sense that a standalone report
  for the internship work is required.

Here are some companies and organizations that have hosted internships with us
in the past: Gazelle, Prinoth, Garmin/Tacx, Swugo, B-Cells, Team DSM, SymPy,
Bikefitting.com, TrueKinetix, velolab.de, TU Delft Sports Engineering
Institute, Aalborg University Sports Sciences.

Literature Study
----------------

10 ECs (280 hours, ~7 weeks full time)

- If you are a BMD or BME student, read the relevant guidance docs found on
  Brightspace.
- Arrange an initial meeting with your supervisor(s) to discuss how to get
  started on the literature study and to discuss the general topic area of the
  study.
- Review the "MSc Literature Review Assessment Rubric" on the `3mE MSc Forms`_
  page.
- Read "How to read a paper" and "Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Literature
  Review" and review the "The Literature Review Process" website in the
  `recommended reading section
  <{filename}/pages/guide.rst#recommended-reading>`_.
- Choose and learn a tool/method to organize your papers and notes (e.g.
  Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote, Excel).
- The first goal is to read a large quantity of paper abstracts (phase 1 in
  "How to Read a Paper") to get a broad sense of what people are researching
  about the topics of interest.
- The second goal is to formulate a research question(s) that you can likely
  answer with the papers you read.
- Once you have a research question in mind, arrange a meeting with your
  supervisors to formally present the question and receive feedback (this
  should occur within the first two weeks of work). You should prepare a slide
  presentation or similar to help communicate this.
- The third goal is to delve deep into papers that are closely related to your
  research question, analyze and critique them, and synthesize the knowledge
  you obtain from them into a coherent answer to you research question.
- Before writing your report read "The Science of Scientific Writing" and "How
  to write a good (enough) report" in the `recommend reading section
  <{filename}/pages/guide.rst#recommended-reading>`_.
- Lastly, write up your findings for a technical audience in a way that answers
  your research question.
- Once you have a first full draft of the literature study, request feedback
  from your supervisors. This usually takes a week. You can arrange a meeting
  to receive verbal feedback also. Use the feedback to improve your document
  and then submit it to your supervisors for their official assessment and
  grade.
- For BMD students, as you approach the finish of your literature study you
  should schedule your colloquium, where you will present the results of your
  literature study to your peers. We encourage you to practice your colloquium
  with an ad hoc group from the lab or at a lab meeting. Send an invite to your
  colloquium to the lab.

MSc Thesis
----------

35 ECs (980 hours, ~25 weeks full time)

Basic Steps:

- Submit MSc initiation form (BME/BMD form 4, other tracks may have a different
  form). You may do this at the start of your literature study, if appropriate.
- Formulate a research question or hypothesis that you'd like address in
  consultation with your supervisors (this usually occurs in the later portion
  of your literature study period and is informed by your literature study
  findings).
- Develop a written project plan (3 pages) and submit it to your supervisor(s)
  before the kickoff meeting so they have time to read it. The plan should
  address:

  - your research question/aim/goals
  - your basic technical approach to answer the research question or achieve
    you design (include your proposed methods, simulations, analyses, models,
    sketches, experimental methods, etc.)
  - a timeline that includes major milestones with dates, your expected holiday
    time, and a buffer for delays
  - what resources you will likely need for the project

- Organize a kickoff meeting with all of your supervisors to formally present
  your research project and project plan. This should be slide presentation or
  similar.
- Adjust your project plan based on the feedback at the kickoff meeting.
- Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.
- Present your progress at a midterm meeting with a formal presentation and
  with all of your supervisors present. The midterm should occur after you have
  significant preliminary results that demonstrate you can succeed in the final
  project execution.
- Work on the project with your daily supervisor's guidance.
- Once you are getting close to a draft thesis arrange a Go/No-Go meeting. This
  meeting should include all of your supervisors that will be on your defense
  committee except the "external independent member". Typically give the
  supervisors one week to read and comment on the draft before the meeting.
  Prepare a (strictly) 10 minute slide presentation to get everyone up to speed
  at the beginning of the meeting.
- If you get a "Go" at the Go/No-Go meeting then you should initiate the
  arrangement of your defense by submitting the correct forms to your track
  coordinators and department secretaries.
- If you get a "No-Go", at the Go/No-Go meeting then take the supervisors'
  feedback and improve your work until you are ready for another Go/No-Go
  meeting.
- When you have a "Go", edit your thesis based on the supervisors' feedback.
  When you have a final version of your thesis, send it to your supervisors two
  weeks before the defense and submit it to the TU Delft Education Repository.
  Make sure to add an embargo if your work requires one.
- Follow the `Data Management Guide
  <{filename}/pages/guide-data-management.rst>`_ and deliver your project
  assets to the lab principle investigator and any partner organizations.

- If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
  sensitive information you will need to arrange the "Graduation Agreement at a
  Company" that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
  here here:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/.
  Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.
