The TU Delft Bicycle Lab is a research lab in the `Biomechatronics &
Human-Machine Control Group`_ of the `BioMechanical Engineering Department`_ at
`Delft University of Technology`_ led by `Jason K. Moore`_. Our research is
centered around the science and engineering of bicycles and spans the following
themes:

- single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control
- improving design of bicycles and other human powered vehicles
- enhancing athlete performance and safety in sports (cycling & more)
- bicycle and micromobility transportation improvements and safety
- human powered appropriate technology
- engineering and scientific software design and development
- teaching and learning in engineering education

History
=======

Dr. Jason K. Moore did his graduate research in Mont Hubbard's `Sports
Biomechanics Lab`_ at the `University of California, Davis`_ where bicycles
were an often topic of study, as far back as the early 1990s. The Delft
University of Technology Bicycle Dynamics Lab started in the mid 2000's under
the direction of `Arend L. Schwab`_ after his sabbatical at Cornell University
with Andy Ruina where he revived Andy's and Jim Papadopoulos's bicycle dynamics
research from the 1980's. Jason spent one year of his Ph.D. studies at the TU
Delft Bicycle Dynamics Lab starting in 2008. In 2015, Jason was hired on the UC
Davis Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering faculty and started the
"Laboratorium of Marvelous Mechanical Motum" where he furthered bicycle
engineering research. Dr. Schwab retired in 2021 and Jason took over his lab
and research program in Delft where he merged his UC Davis based research
program with TU Delft's, defining what exists today.
