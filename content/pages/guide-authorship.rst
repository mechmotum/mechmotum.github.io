Guide: Authorship

Credit as an author is one of the primary currencies for recognition and
advancement in academia. People often want authorship in academia with similar
fervor that people want money in daily life. This means that assigning
authorship may not always be easy. There are also different customs in
different research fields when assigning authorship. It behooves you to learn
about this nuanced activity we must navigate when working in academia.

For officially and unofficially published works that members of the bicycle lab
produce which have an author list where Jason plays a role as an advisor or
supervisor, the guidelines below should be followed [1]_. If Jason is not
involved in that role, you should follow whatever guidelines and custom your
authorship team follows.

Definitions
===========

First Author
   This generally should be the person that did most of the physical and
   intellectual labor for the content of the written work. If it isn't, there
   should be a very good reason.
Lead Author
   Typically the person who initiates and leads the production of the written
   work. This is usually one person and they are responsible for the official
   submission of the manuscript somewhere. This is most often the first author,
   but need not be.

Customs
=======

In mechanical engineering,

- It is customary to list the person that made the primary contribution and did
  the majority of the physical and intellectual labor as the first author.
- If an immediate advisor/supervisor of a student, PhD candidate, or Postdoc is
  a co-author on the manuscript, they are listed last. This is because
  promotion judgement committees look for professors' last author listing as a
  sign of leadership.
- It is unclear if there is any common way the intermediate authors are
  ordered.

Guidelines
==========

- Your thesis or dissertation is a single author document. The purpose of this
  document is to demonstrate that you can create such a document by yourself
  with only guidance from your advisors. In essence, you write every single
  sentence and produce every single figure and no one else would write any
  sentences.
- If your thesis or dissertation includes one or more papers that have
  co-authorship, then you have to explain clearly in the thesis or dissertation
  what your individual contributions are. The CRediT_ system is a helpful
  framework for doing so. In principle, you should only include papers you are
  first author on, unless there is some special circumstance. Co-authors must
  consent to you including the paper in your thesis or dissertation.
- The ICMJE_ recommends authorship be based on four criteria and we use these
  criteria as our foundation for assigning authorship (quoted here):

  1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the
     acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
  2. Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual
     content; AND
  3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND
  4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that
     questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are
     appropriately investigated and resolved.

- When you lead a co-authored manuscript you should discuss with each person
  that may have made substantial contributions to see if they desire to be a
  co-author. There is no hard definition of what "substantial contributions"
  universally means, so this boils down to an interpersonal negotiation where
  the lead author has the responsibility to make things fair to the best of
  their ability.
- Once you have negotiated the list of authors, they all must then do points
  2., 3., and 4. in the ICJME criteria list to be confirmed as authors.
- You should never submit a manuscript to any publishing venue without the
  consent of all authors and agreement on points 1-4. It is the submitter's
  responsibility to give enough time for points 1-4 to be worked out. If
  reasonable time and deadlines have been given, and co-authors do not meet
  1-4, they should be moved to the acknowledgements section of the paper. This
  should likely never be done for a journal paper due to its importance, but
  for less consequential things, like an abstract, it may be fine.
- Explicitly propose the author order and get all authors agreement on it. If
  there is disagreement, the lead author should facilitate an agreement.
- It is perfectly fine to do projects and write papers without the involvement
  of Jason. Please do that! He should not be co-author on papers where he
  didn't meet points 1-4 even if he obtained your funding. Of course, he loves
  to be invited for topics he is interested in and has time to contribute.

.. [1] These are, of course, open for debate, but we should try to be
   consistent.
