Description
===========

We are seeking a PhD researcher for a 4-year contract in a multidisciplinary
research project to improve the safety of bicyclists and automated vehicles.

Transportation of the future will include a mixture of automated vehicles (AVs)
and vulnerable road users (VRUs), like bicyclists and pedestrians. Unregulated
mixing of automated vehicles into urban areas has the potential to cause a rise
in transportation related death and injury. This mixing also exacerbates safety
concerns for vulnerable road users. Current VRU detection and its associated
trajectory planning are based on information that is collected solely from AV
sensors which is not sufficient to accurately predict the near-future behavior
of vulnerable road users. We want to validate the hypothesis that digital
information sharing among all road users combined with physiologically and
dynamically realistic predictive models can guarantee overall safety. Our
project goal is to achieve safe and socially acceptable interactions among
automated vehicles and vulnerable bicyclists in dense urban environments by
leveraging information shared in a two-way vehicleâ†”bicycle (V2B/B2V)
communication system.

You will be supervised by Dr. Jason K. Moore, Dr. Azita Dabiri, Dr. Frederik
Schulte, and Dr. Ir. Riender Happee. You will work with BSc, MSc, and PhD
candidates in the involved research groups that span the BioMechanical
Engineering, Cognitive Robotics, Delft Center for Systems and Control, and
Maritime and Transport Technology departments. Specifically, the PhD candidate
will have the opportunity to collaborate with others for human in the loop
evaluation in terms of acceptance and perceived safety.

Opportunities for growing your academic career will be available, such as
mentoring BSc/MSc Students, conference presentations, networking, and teaching.

We are looking for candidates that can start during the summer of 2022.

Requirements
============

You should have:

- MSc in engineering or similar discipline by the start date of the position
- Experience with simulation
- Experience with a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, Matlab, etc.)
- Good written and oral communication skills in English

The following aspects will help you stand out:

- Thriving in multidisciplinary environments
- Self-motivation
- Curiosity-driven working attitude
- Knowledge of control theory, transportation systems, machine learning, or
  vehicle dynamics
- Prior experience with SUMO (https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)

Keep in mind that this describes the background we imagine would best fit the
role. Even if you do not meet all the requirements and feel that you are up for
the task, we absolutely want to see your application!

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to
ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate
in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and
a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission
Requirements.

To Apply
========

Submit:

- Motivation and CV.
- A 1-page original research proposal with your ideas for addressing the
  problems described in the description.
- Abstract of your MSc thesis
- Contact information for up to 3 references
- List of grades
