Bart de Vries successfully defended his MSc thesis titled `Low-Speed Cargo
Bicycle Balance: Design, Implementation, and Validation of an Active Kickstand
Stabilization Mechanism for Low-Speed Cargo Bicycle Balance
<https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:9c4f9f29-5f2f-4c67-93c8-58ddcb054641>`_ on
July 15, 2025. Two-wheeled cargo bicycles with heavy loads can be hard to
handle at low speeds or when loading and unloading the vehicle. Bart developed
an active kickstand system with two independently operated robotic legs. The
legs deploy and support the bike when the speed approaches to zero and the
system will level the bicycle even if on uneven ground. When starting the legs
retract as you gain sufficient speed for balancing the bicycle. Bart proved
that the design can manage large loads, significant uneven surfaces, and that
the system does not detract too much from the e-bike battery life.

Bart was supervised by Jason K. Moore. Everyone at the bicycle lab is very
proud of Bart and wishes him the best in his next adventures.
