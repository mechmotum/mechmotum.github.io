Dorus de Boer successfully defended "`Modeling a Professional Road Cycling Race
To Determine the Fastest Wheel-Tire Combination
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:cc610be1-3aa2-4658-8584-2b1e7075f75a>`_". He
developed a simulation based model that can assess past road races and test
whether different wheels and tires would have improved the overall race time.
This information can be used to inform choices about future races and provide
quantitative metrics for these choices. Dorus was co-supervised by Harm Ubbens
(Team DSM), Piet Rooijakkers (Team DSM), and Jason K. Moore (TU Delft).
Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Dorus and wishes him the best in
his next step in his career.
