Eloy V치zquez Fern치ndez successfully defended his MSc thesis titled `Vibration
Impact on Cycling Performance: Understanding power loss due to vibration and
the parameters that influence it
<https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:c33246b4-b42e-49cb-b042-c0b7ee4a0ac0>`_ on
July 17, 2025.

Eloy devised a set of experiments to mimic the vibration experienced cycling
over cobblestones from 10 to 30 km/h and carefully measured the power loss
caused by the vibrations. He tested two postures (seated normally and up off
the saddle), three muscle contraction states (normal, relaxed, and stiff), and
a range of tire pressures (3.5 to 5.5 bar). He showed that vibrational losses
can equal or exceed aerodynamic losses on a rough surface like cobblestones.
Lowering the tire pressure or rising from the saddle can save about 200 watts
at 30 km/h. He proposed a quadratic model to relate speed and vibrational power
loss which is a departure from the classic rolling resistance models that are
linear in the speed. Overall vibration power losses can contribute up to 60% of
the total power loss traversing cobblestones, showing vibration power loss
needs more attention than it has historically received. Eloy also calls into
question the use of the International Roughness Index (IRI) for classifying
road roughness for these purposes because it neglects the variation of
vibration across frequencies.

Eloy was supervised by Jason K. Moore and Jim Papadopoulos. Everyone at the
bicycle lab is very proud of Eloy and wishes him the best in his next
adventures in Sheffield to further study sports engineering.
