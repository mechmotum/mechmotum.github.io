Jan Heinen successfully defended "`Optimal Skateboard Geometry for Maximizing
Ollie Height
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:61f4e969-8bd1-4687-9942-b70024b216dc>`_". He
developed a skateboard and skateboarder model capable of performing an ollie_.
He used trajectory optimization to maximize the height of the skateboard ollie
under physiological and dynamic constraints. Then he used his solver to
optimize the skateboard's geometry to increase the height of the ollie. He
found a variety of board designs that could be ollied higher than a typical
board design with the best gaining 10 cm in height. The video below shows
animations of the results:

Jan was co-supervised by Raymund ten Broek (Urban Sports Performance Center),
Eline van der Kruk (TU Delft), and Jason K. Moore (TU Delft). Sam Brockie (TU
Delft) also provided mentorship. Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of
Jan and wishes him the best in his next adventures.
