Jan van der Schot successfully defended "`The Relationship between Equivalent
Fall Height and Ground Reaction Force in Freestyle Ski Jumping
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:98476791-40be-4ee5-ab3a-3f1a9d5e63cb>`_". Jan
measured both the trajectories of ski jump flight and the shape of the landing
surface with high accuracy differential GPS for over 100 jumps. Using these
measures he calculated the equivalent fall height at the landing location to
compare to peak ground reaction force using data from chest and back mounted
accelerometers. Jan found that ground reaction force increases with equivalent
fall height but that it is difficult to predict the ground reaction force from
equivalent fall height alone, likely due to landing strategy and environment
differences.

Jan was co-supervised by Daniel RÃ¶ck (Prinoth AG), Mont Hubbard (University of
California, Davis), and Jason K. Moore (TU Delft). Everyone at the bicycle lab
is very proud of Jan and wishes him the best in his next adventures.
