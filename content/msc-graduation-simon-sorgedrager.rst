Simon Sorgedgrager successfully defended his MSc thesis titled `Riding a
Bicycle Without Hands: How To Do It and the Bicycle Dynamics Behind It
<https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:ee22c5d1-b27f-4542-8a49-71d92a9e2f55>`_ on
April 25, 2025. Simon created variations of bicycle rider upper-body models for
use in the study of controlling the non-linear Carvallo-Whipple bicycle model.
In particular, he developed a model of the rider's seat-butt connection that
imposes a configuration constraint that better mimics the motion we have
observed in no-hands riding. He also developed a triple pendulum model that
includes motion of the head. He then solved optimal path tracking problems to
find solutions for making lane changes, 90 degree turns, and staying on a
straight path when subject to wind. He discovered several new and interesting
things through these optimal control solutions:

- The rider uses less control energy to make a lane change with the new seat
  joint than typical pin joint pendulum models. This implies that the strategy
  of shifting the seat laterally under your butt is a more effective way to
  manipulate the roll angle of the bicycle.
- When subjected to lateral wind forces, the rider leans into the wind to
  maintain a straight path.
- A rider can make a turn **without countersteering** with carefully
  coordinated upper body contortions.

Simon developed all of the models with `SymBRiM
<https://github.com/mechmotum/symbrim>`_ and solved the optimal control
problems with `opty <https://github.com/csu-hmc/opty>`_. Simon's code is found
at https://github.com/mechmotum/no-hands-riding.

The following animations show the rider model variations performing a lane
change:

Simon was co-supervised by Jason K. Moore and José Farías. Everyone at the
bicycle lab is very proud of Simon and wishes him the best in his next
adventures.
