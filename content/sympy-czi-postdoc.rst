Description
===========

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab is seeking a postdoctoral researcher for a 1 year
equivalent contract (full or part time). You will work on a sub-project of
`SymPy's "Improving Foundational Open Source Symbolic Mathematics for Science"
grant
<https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/sympy-improving-foundational-open-source-symbolic-mathematics-for-science/>`_
funded by the `Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation’s “Essential Open Source Software for
Science" program
<https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/>`_.
The purpose of the overall grant is to improve the SymPy Python symbolic
mathematics library in the key areas of performance, code generation, and
documentation. The `full grant proposal
<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16590053.v1>`_ is available publicly on
Figshare.

We believe SymPy is the most widely used general purpose open source computer
algebra system (CAS). The software is over 16 years old and has over 800k
downloads per month on PyPi. It is a full featured CAS, with over 700k lines of
Python code. `The SymPy paper (Meurer, Aaron, et al. "SymPy: Symbolic computing
in Python." PeerJ Computer Science 3 (2017): e103.)
<http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.103>`_ describes the software and some of
its uses.

Code generation plays a central role in SymPy’s roadmap for supporting
scientific codes. The code generation roadmap prioritizes usability, generating
high performance code, and supporting a wide array of languages. This
postdoctoral research project will focus on improving usability and performance
of code generation guided by a performance critical musculoskeletal model
application. This model will be adopted from a bicycle vehicle model and a
human upper body and arm model. This human-vehicle model includes stiff
dynamics, holonomic and nonholonomic constraints, thousands of algebraic
operations, and complex force definitions; all features that strain SymPy’s
ability to best competitors in advanced biomechanical simulations.

The postdoctoral research project has two primary outcomes:

1. Improve SymPy’s numerical code generation capabilities for general use
   cases.
2. Develop a musculoskeletal driven bicycle model that demonstrates domain
   specific improvements to the code generation capabilities of SymPy.

The developed software will be contributed to SymPy as open source software
(BSD) and the modeling results will be submitted to appropriate scientific
journals.

You will simultaneously work as a member of the TU Delft Bicycle Lab and the
SymPy development team. You will work with BSc, MSc, and PhD candidates in the
lab as well as members of the SymPy community. You will work with and be
directly mentored by Jason K. Moore.

This position offers flexible work hours, the possibility of remote work
(country dependent), and the possibility of full or part time work.

Opportunities for growing your academic career will be available, such as
mentoring BSc/MSc Students and PhD candidates, conference presentations,
networking, teaching, and grant writing.

Requirements
============

You should have:

* A STEM Ph.D. by the start date of the position
* Proficiency with the Python programming language
* Good written and oral communication skills in English

The following skills will help you stand out:

* Open source software contribution best practices and experience
* Experience with SymPy
* Experience with symbolic computation, numerical computing, and/or code generation
* Experience with C/C++ or Fortran
* Computational multibody dynamics experience
* Musculoskeletal modeling experience

Keep in mind that this describes the background we imagine would best fit the
role. Even if you do not meet all of the requirements and feel that you are up
for the task, we absolutely want to see your application!

Diversity and Inclusion
=======================

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab and SymPy are committed to advancing diversity,
equity, and inclusion efforts across open source software development with this
position, aligning with CZI’s goals. We especially encourage applicants from
underrepresented groups in open source software to apply.

TU Delft values a safe, inclusive and diverse work environment. To reinforce
that, we have committed ourselves to the joint `Statement Social Safety
<https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news.html/nieuwsbericht/512>`_ of the Association of
Universities in the Netherlands and the `National Action Plan for Diversity and
Inclusion
<https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/09/01/nieuw-nationaal-actieplan-voor-diversiteit-en-inclusie>`_.
In addition to that, we have a Social Safety Programme.

To Apply
========

Submit (in PDF format) a 1 page cover letter explaining your motivation and fit
for the position, a C.V., one example peer reviewed scientific publication
where you are the primary author, and examples of your Python software
development proficiency (URLs to public code are encouraged).
