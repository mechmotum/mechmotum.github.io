**Challenge**: Quality bicycle crash data is essentially non-existent so we
have to use low quality videos from chance encounters to create accurate
reconstructions of the physics of these crashes.

**Change**: We want to study how these crashes occur through the lens of
physical simulation.

**Impact**: Once we understand how crashes occur we want to use the knowledge
to make bicycling safer and reduce crashes.     

Description
===========

We are seeking a PhD researcher for a 4-year contract to develop simulation and
data analysis tools that lead us to understanding the mechanisms at play in
bicycle and other two-wheeler crashes. You will work primarily with video data
and computational neuromuscular models to develop the next generation of
predictive algorithms that connect human control to bicycle crash dynamics.

Your project is partially supported by the `OpenSim Creator: Empowering
Biomedical Research with Biomechanical Models
<https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/opensim-creator-empowering-biomedical-research-with-biomechanical-models/>`_
grant funded by the `Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation’s “Essential Open Source
Software for Science" program
<https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/>`_.
The software developed during the research will be contributed to OpenSim as
open source software and the research results will be submitted to appropriate
scientific journals and conferences.

You will simultaneously work as a member of the Computational Biomechanics Lab
and the Bicycle Lab both part of the BioMechanical Engineering Department. You
will be supervised by Dr. Jason K. Moore and Dr. Ajay Seth. You will work BSc,
MSc, and PhD candidates in the involved research groups from the BioMechanical
Engineering Department and other departments in the university.

Opportunities for growing your academic career will be available, such as
mentoring BSc/MSc Students, conference presentations, networking, and teaching.

Requirements
============

You should have:

- MSc in engineering or similar discipline by the start date of the position
- Experience with simulation
- Experience with a programming language (e.g., C++, Python, Java, Matlab,
  etc.)
- Experience with collecting experimental data (vehicle, biomechanic, video, or
  similar)
- Good written and oral communication skills in English

The following aspects will help you stand out:

- Thriving in multidisciplinary environments
- Self-motivation
- Curiosity-driven working attitude
- Knowledge of biomechanical modeling, vision based motion capture, machine
  learning, control systems

Keep in mind that this describes the background we imagine would best fit the
role. Even if you do not meet all the requirements and feel that you are up for
the task, we absolutely want to see your application! The PhD process is a
learning experience.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to
ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate
in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and
a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission
Requirements.
