`Ajaypal Singh`_ successfully defended "`Investigation of the chatter and
squeal phenomenon in bicycle disc brakes
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:dd809802-ea24-48b2-b63c-150611f612c9>`_". He
developed methods to experimentally determine combinations of bicycle
components that cause disc brake noise, developed an FEA model that can predict
disc brake squeal frequencies, and introduced simple countermeasures that
reduce unwanted squealing noises. Ajaypal was co-supervised by Hans Vreman
(Gazelle), Andrew Dressel (TU Delft), and Jason Moore (TU Delft). This project
was part of the ClickNL funded Fiets van de Toekomst grant. Everyone at the
bicycle lab is very proud of Ajaypal and wishes him the best in his next step
in his career.
