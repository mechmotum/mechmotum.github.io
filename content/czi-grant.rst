The TU Delft Bicycle Lab has been awarded approximately one third of a $350k
grant to the SymPy_ project from the Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation as part of
their "Essential Open Source Software for Science" program. SymPy is joining a
host of exciting open source software projects in this program. This is SymPy's
first large funding injection in its 15 year history. Here at TU Delft, we'll
be hiring a postdoctoral researcher in the coming months for a 1 FTE position
for a year to focus on improving SymPy's code generation tools and
demonstrating the power of the code generation on an advanced bicycle control
neuromuscular model.
