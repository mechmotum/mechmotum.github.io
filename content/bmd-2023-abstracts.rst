All six of the Bicycle Lab's submissions to the 2023 Bicycle and Motorcycle
Dynamics conference were accepted. We have had a very productive past year and
are excited to show off some of the research. You can read the abstracts and
the scientific committee's reviews on Orvium.

MSc student Timo Stienstra will present about his new bicycle and rider
modeling software package:

   Extensible Open-Source Framework for Creating Bicycle-Rider Models. The
   Evolving Scholar - BMD 2023, 5th Edition.

MSc student Floris van Willigen will present about his handling measurements of
our new tilting tricycle:

   a tilting tricycle with variable stability. The Evolving Scholar - BMD 2023,
   5th Edition. https://doi.org/10.24404/63fe2e2127799c0b2d1600b8

PhD student Christoph Schmidt will introduce his work modelling bicycle
dynamics and control in a traffic environment:

PhD student Gabriele Dell'Orto will present the tire measurements of a small
bicycle tire used for the front wheel of many bakfiets:

(Past) Postdoc Andrew Dressel will present on the design of our new tilting
tricycle:
