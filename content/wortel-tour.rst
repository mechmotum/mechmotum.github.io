Several members of the Bicycle Laboratorium went on our first bicycle tour,
which we hope to make an annual tradition! We bicycled from Delft to the
Wortel-Kolonie_ in Belgium. Belgium hosts free camping spots "bivakzone_" for
through hikers and bikers around the country and we stayed at the one located
in the Wortel-Kolonie.

Those that started in Delft did about 260 km over the two days and I did about
220 km due to the route passing through Rotterdam.
