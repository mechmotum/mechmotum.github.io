<div class="section" id="common-issues">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Common Issues</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="conciseness">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Conciseness</a></h3>
<p>Conciseness typically equates to clarity. Edit things down, keep removing until
only the essential information is present.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-to-use-a-figure">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">When to use a figure</a></h3>
<p>If you refer to a figure in the text, that figure should be nearby the text so
that the reader can read your interpretation of the figure while looking at it.</p>
<p>All figures should be referenced and discussed in the text, i.e. don't just
throw in a figure because you made and it looks nice.</p>
<p>Only insert a figure when it enhances the story you are telling in the text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="figure-and-table-captions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Figure and Table Captions</a></h3>
<p>Figures and tables and their associated captions should be able to be removed
from the text and a reader should still be able to &quot;read&quot; the figure or table.
This means that the caption should help the reader know how to read the figure.
Anything that isn't obvious from the figure's design should be include, e.g.
&quot;The solid black lines represent the real part of the eigenvalue loci for the
fifth eigenmode.&quot; The caption should not include discussion or interpretation
of the figure, that belongs in your primary text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-figures">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-9">Creating figures</a></h3>
<p>Students often create figures that are saved from figure creation software
without any adjustments to the default settings. The default settings are never
appropriate. Search the internet for how to make publication quality figures
with your preferred software. For example here are some</p>
<p>Python</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://atchen.me/research/code/data-viz/2022/01/04/plotting-matplotlib-reference.html">https://atchen.me/research/code/data-viz/2022/01/04/plotting-matplotlib-reference.html</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jbmouret/matplotlib_for_papers">https://github.com/jbmouret/matplotlib_for_papers</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots">SciencePlots</a>: matplotlib
style to give well formatted plots for publication</li>
</ul>
<p>Matlab</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47921-plotpub-publication-quality-graphs-in-matlab">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47921-plotpub-publication-quality-graphs-in-matlab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Common issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The figure is poorly scaled for actual paper sizes.</li>
<li>Bitmap images have either too high or too low resolution. Make your
resolutions 300 dpi (dot per inch).</li>
<li>Font sizes are too small on axis labels and legends, for example.</li>
<li>Grey backgrounds are left in the figure (common for Matlab).</li>
<li>Readers cannot discern individual lines or dots in the plot. For example, you
may have a time series line plot of an accelerometer over 30 minutes. Showing
all 30 minutes is simply a blob of color that is not useful. Show only 1
minute or 30 seconds so that the reader can see the data in a useful context.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="figure-copyright">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-10">Figure Copyright</a></h3>
<p>In general, you cannot include figures you did not create draw yourself in your
document. If you want to include the figure there are essentially three
options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Ask the copyright holder for written permission to use their figure.</li>
<li>If the copyright holder has licensed their figure with a Creative Commons
license (or similar) then you can use the figure if you abide by the
license's rules. This usually means displaying the reference to the license
and the authors.</li>
<li>It may be possible to use the figure without permission if the use falls
under an exception in your jurisdiction. Dutch Law seems to have exceptions
for &quot;Illustration for teaching or scientific research&quot;, &quot;Quotation for
criticism or review&quot;, and &quot;Use for the purpose of research or private
study&quot;. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_Netherlands">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_Netherlands</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="math">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">Math</a></h3>
<p>Take time to typeset your math equations and number each equation for
referencing in the text. Follow mathematical notation standards to make it easy
for the readers.</p>
<p>Do not use <span class="math">\(a*b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a\times b\)</span> to indicate scalar multiplication,
<span class="math">\(ab\)</span> is clear and more than sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="latex">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">LaTeX</a></h3>
<p>This is how you do quotes in LaTeX!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>`single quoted stuff&#39;
``double quoted stuff&#39;&#39;
</pre></div>
<p>Backticks on the left quotes are necessary to obtain correctly formatted
quotation marks.</p>
<p>Prevent undesired linebreaks with the tilde <cite>~</cite>. For example, you don't want a
citation to be on a new line by itself at the end of a sentence.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This is my long sentence and this is a fact~<span class="k">\cite</span><span class="nb">{</span>JohnDoe2000<span class="nb">}</span>.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">Code</a></h3>
<p>There is no reason to include long scripts and programs in your thesis. If a
product of your thesis project is code, it is best to archive your code in the
proper file formats to something like Zenodo or Figshare and then cite in your
thesis. You can also upload an archive of the code to the TU Delft thesis
repository. It is appropriate to include code if you want the reader to read
it. For example you may demonstrate an algorithm by showing a short snippet of
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-14">Appendices</a></h3>
<p>Appendices are not just a clearing house to dump all the extra figures and
tables you generated. Appendices are ancillary chapters and sections of your
work. They provide supporting, but not necessary, information for the story in
your main chapters. For example, if you say in a main chapter &quot;We measured the
stiffness of 10 bicycle tires and use those values in the model, see Appendix
A.&quot; then appendix A should be a new section with written content that explains
this measurement procedure and the results. If it was in the main text it would
distract the reader from your main points, e.g. model description, but if the
reader questions your stiffness values they can then read the appendix to see
how you arrived at the values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="referencing-commercial-equipment">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-15">Referencing commercial equipment</a></h3>
<p>You need to specify the product name of the equipment and any version
specifications, then in parentheses list the company name, city, and country.
Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I applied a 6 Hz Butterworth low-pass filter to the signal using the
<tt class="docutils literal">butter()</tt> function available in Matlab 2019a (Mathworks, Natick, USA).</p>
<p>Each vehicle was equipped with a VR IMU BN0086 MEMs inertial measurement
unit (Sparkfun, Niwot, USA).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-size">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-16">File size</a></h3>
<p>There is little reason for the PDF of a thesis to be larger than 10 MB. If your
document is larger than 10 MB, then you have most likely embedded images that
are much too large. Reduce the size of images before embedding and make sure to
use .jpg images, rather than .png. A 300 dpi image that fits on an A4 page
should only be a few hundred kilobytes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statement-on-ai-assistance">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-17">Statement On AI Assistance</a></h3>
<p>If you make use of writing tools that can essentially write text for you you
must make a statement in your document explaining how you used such a tool. You
should also be cautious when using such tools because the copyright of the text
that it produces is ambiguous. The text is a derivative of other people's
(copyrighted) writing and you may not want to laden your writing with possible
copyright infringements. Nonetheless, make a statement on the use of the tool,
for example:</p>
<blockquote>
During the preparation of this work the author(s) used ChatGPT 12x in order
to improve the grammar in the writing. After using this tool/service, the
author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full
responsibility for the content of the publication.</blockquote>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="style">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-18">Style</a></h2>
<p>There are many writing styles; some styles fit with the norms in scientific
writing and some do not. It is extremely important to make your academic
reports and papers as easy to understand as possible. Some style choices will
help you write more clearly.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Write in active voice unless the context really needs passive voice to make
things clearer.</li>
<li>Write in present tense unless necessary to write in other tenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allen Downey has some nice style notes: <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/style-guide">https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/style-guide</a></p>
<div class="section" id="active-voice-vs-passive-voice">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-19">Active Voice vs Passive Voice</a></h3>
<p>You should write in active voice as your primary mode. Writing in active voice
is generally simpler and clearer. Use passive voice sparingly. There should be
a specific reason to use passive voice. Most major journals' style guides now
request active voice. The Wikipedia article &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_passive_voice">English passive voice</a>&quot;  is a
good starting point to learn about the differences in active and passive and
style recommendations. Allen Downey also has a couple quick reads that may help
convince you of the merit of using active voice in scientific writing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://allendowney.com/essays/passive.html">https://allendowney.com/essays/passive.html</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/12/18/please-stop-teaching-people-to-write-about-science-in-the-passive-voice/">https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/12/18/please-stop-teaching-people-to-write-about-science-in-the-passive-voice/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initialisms-and-acronyms">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-20">Initialisms and Acronyms</a></h3>
<p>Don't use them. For every acronym or initialism you invent, it causes the
reader to have to jump back to your definition every time they see it. The more
you invent the more painful this is. There are two cases where it may be ok to
use them: 1) the initialism or acronym is very commonly known to the expected
audience, e.g.  &quot;PID&quot; is an initialism that any control engineer would know, 2)
you invent a single initialism or acronym for your paper due to repeating the
phrase a <em>very</em> large number of times. Never use initialisms or acronyms in
titles or abstracts.  Always define any initialism or acronym (that your or
others invented) on the first use of the phrase. If your sentences have more
than one or two acronyms or initialisms present, you should likely write the
phrases out to ease reading. Initialisms and acronyms make it easier for the
writer but not the reader.</p>
