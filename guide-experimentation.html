    <p>If your project involves doing physical experiments, you will need to develop a
plan, assemble the resources and equipment needed, recruit assistants, possibly
recruit human subjects, and execute your experiment. It is of utmost importance
to plan your experiments in meticulous detail and practice it before executing.
Doing experiments have a higher resource cost (money, people's time, loaned
equipment, etc.) than theoretical and simulation studies and you want to
minimize the chances that those resources are wasted in any way. You absolutely
do not want to have to redo a human subjects experiment. A well designed and
written plan will make it easy for others to help you succeed.</p>
<p>This is general process we recommend following to ensure a successful
experiment:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Develop the theoretical foundation</dt>
<dd>This often occurs during a literature study phase and kickoff phase of your
project. You should develop a research question and/or hypotheses that can
be answered via, in some part, experimentation.</dd>
<dt>Develop measurement specifications</dt>
<dd>Based on the mathematical theory you've developed, you will need to measure
different physical quantities. It is important to identify which quantities
can be measured directly (e.g. temperature sensor for temperature) and those
that need to be estimated (e.g. altitude from barometric pressure). You
should create minimum specifications for your measurement needs that include
accuracy, precision, range, sampling rate, streaming data, time
synchronization, etc.</dd>
<dt>Look for measurement solutions</dt>
<dd>Once you know precisely your minimum specifications for the desired
measurements, you have to find sensors and tools to collect these
measurements. You should source these from the bike lab's existing
equipment, the 3mE MeetShop, borrow from other labs at the University, build
the sensors yourself, or buy new sensors (in that order). To understand the
possibilities, chat with existing lab members and refer to the many
textbooks on engineering and scientific measurements (e.g.  <a class="citation-reference" href="#morris2001" id="citation-reference-1">[Morris2001]</a>.
Developing your measurement specifications and looking for measurement
solutions is an iterative process. You will need to adjust your
specifications once you learn what resources are realistically available.</dd>
<dt>Design your experiments</dt>
<dd>You now need to work out what your experiment will be and how you will do
it. Here you answer questions like: how many subjects do I need? how many
repetitions are necessary? what variables are changed and which are fixed?
where will the experiments occur? who will perform them? There is a
scientific field called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments">Design of Experiments</a> dedicated to designing
experiments that can be evaluated in a statistically sound way and provides
methods on deciding variables, number of trials, repetitions, etc. Books
like <a class="citation-reference" href="#anderson2018" id="citation-reference-2">[Anderson2018]</a> give an introduction to the ideas. Many of the other
things to figure out at this stage are specific to the nature of the
experiment and involve attending to various logistics.</dd>
<dt>Write a experimental plan</dt>
<dd>Once you know what you want to do (in a precise scientific and engineering
sense), you should draft an experimental plan document. The purpose of this
document is two-fold: 1) to organize your ideas and plans for yourself and
2) to communicate your plans to others. The document should include an
objective for the experiments and introduction, description of the
experimental methods, resources you will use and/or need, a budget, time
planning, location information, safety concerns and how you can address
them, and a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(science)">protocol</a> for the experiment (step-by-step recipe of the
experiment). See <a class="reference external" href="https://depts.washington.edu/wildfire/resources/protckl.pdf">this document</a> for ideas
about what can be in a protocol. Share this document with your advisors to
get feedback and to initiate their support in obtaining resources for your
experiment.</dd>
<dt>Minimal viable measurement setup</dt>
<dd>Once you have a plan you need to try out elements of your methods to make
sure they actually work as you think they will. This usually involves a
series of mini-tests and mini-experiments to get all of your measurements
working. It may also involve creating new sensors and measurement
techniques. Try to make use of existing equipment to validate you ability to
measure what you want before purchasing or creating new equipment.</dd>
<dt>Pilot experiment</dt>
<dd>Once you have your measurement system working you will need to pilot your
protocol. If your experiment involves human subjects this typically involves
testing the experiment on yourself. You should execute your protocol
completely as if it were the real experiment and collect a pilot set of data
to analyze. Make sure to review all safety aspects of your protocol with
your advisor(s) before performing the experiment. Take copious notes on what
does and doesn't work in your protocol, so that you adjust for the real
experiments.</dd>
<dt>Analyze pilot data</dt>
<dd>It is critical that you analyze your pilot data to ensure your measurements
provide sufficient information to guaranteed that your study's overall data
analysis can succeed. Much of the time this means ensuring that you can
calculate all summary statistics reliably and accurately. You don't want to
find out after doing the final experiments that you have missed a critical
measurement or that a measurement is too noisy to be useful. Once again, the
experiment piloting process is iterative. You have to iterative until you
know your experiment functions and provides adequate data.</dd>
<dt>Finalize the protocol</dt>
<dd>Once you know your experiment is sound, write up the finalized protocol.
Make sure it has all details necessary for another person to execute the
experiment.</dd>
<dt>Human subjects ethics</dt>
<dd>If your study involves human subjects you need to have your experiment
reviewed by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/human-research-ethics">TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee</a>. Follow the
procedures outlined by the committee. We have past examples in the lab
Google Drive. You may be able to submit this before the protocol is
finalized, as long as nothing would be different with respect to ethical
concerns.</dd>
<dt>Prepare for the real experiments</dt>
<dd>Finalize all of your preparations, including recruiting human subjects,
recruiting assistants, planning with partners, and organize all the final
logistics.</dd>
<dt>Execute your experiments</dt>
<dd>If all of the above is in order, then the real experiments should go like
clockwork.</dd>
